chapter
truth
universally
acknowledged
that
single
man
in
possession
good
fortune
must
be
in
want
wife
however
little
known
feelings
or
views
such
man
may
be
on
his
first
entering
neighbourhood
truth
so
well
fixed
in
minds
surrounding
families
that
he
considered
rightful
property
some
one
or
other
their
daughters
my
dear
mr
bennet
said
his
lady
to
him
one
day
you
heard
that
netherfield
park
let
at
last
mr
bennet
replied
that
he
had
not
but
returned
she
for
mrs
long
has
just
been
here
she
told
me
about
mr
bennet
made
no
answer
do
you
not
want
to
know
who
has
taken
cried
his
wife
impatiently
you
want
to
tell
me
no
objection
to
hearing
was
invitation
enough
why
my
dear
you
must
know
mrs
long
says
that
netherfield
taken
by
young
man
large
fortune
from
north
england
that
he
came
down
on
monday
in
chaise
four
to
see
place
was
so
much
delighted
with
that
he
agreed
with
mr
morris
immediately
that
he
to
take
possession
before
michaelmas
some
his
servants
to
be
in
house
by
end
next
week
what
his
name
bingley
he
married
or
single
oh
single
my
dear
to
be
sure
single
man
large
fortune
four
or
five
thousand
year
what
fine
thing
for
our
girls
how
so
how
can
affect
them
my
dear
mr
bennet
replied
his
wife
how
can
you
be
so
tiresome
you
must
know
that
thinking
his
marrying
one
them
that
his
design
in
settling
here
design
nonsense
how
can
you
talk
so
but
very
likely
that
he
may
fall
in
love
with
one
them
therefore
you
must
visit
him
as
soon
as
he
comes
see
no
occasion
for
that
you
girls
may
go
or
you
may
send
them
by
themselves
which
perhaps
will
be
still
better
for
as
you
as
handsome
as
any
them
mr
bingley
may
like
you
best
party
my
dear
you
flatter
me
certainly
had
my
share
beauty
but
do
not
pretend
to
be
anything
extraordinary
now
when
woman
has
five
grown
up
daughters
she
ought
to
give
over
thinking
her
own
beauty
in
such
cases
woman
has
not
often
much
beauty
to
think
but
my
dear
you
must
indeed
go
see
mr
bingley
when
he
comes
into
neighbourhood
more
than
engage
for
assure
you
but
consider
your
daughters
only
think
what
an
establishment
would
be
for
one
them
sir
william
lady
lucas
determined
to
go
merely
on
that
account
for
in
general
you
know
they
visit
no
newcomers
indeed
you
must
go
for
will
be
impossible
for
us
to
visit
him
if
you
do
not
you
over
scrupulous
surely
dare
say
mr
bingley
will
be
very
glad
to
see
you
will
send
few
lines
by
you
to
assure
him
my
hearty
consent
to
his
marrying
whichever
he
chooses
girls
though
must
throw
in
good
word
for
my
little
lizzy
desire
you
will
do
no
such
thing
lizzy
not
bit
better
than
others
sure
she
not
half
so
handsome
as
jane
nor
half
so
good
humoured
as
lydia
but
you
always
giving
her
preference
they
none
them
much
to
recommend
them
replied
he
they
silly
ignorant
like
other
girls
but
lizzy
has
something
more
quickness
than
her
sisters
mr
bennet
how
can
you
abuse
your
own
children
in
such
way
you
take
delight
in
vexing
me
you
no
compassion
for
my
poor
nerves
you
mistake
me
my
dear
high
respect
for
your
nerves
they
my
old
friends
heard
you
mention
them
with
consideration
these
last
twenty
years
at
least
ah
you
do
not
know
what
suffer
but
hope
you
will
get
over
live
to
see
many
young
men
four
thousand
year
come
into
neighbourhood
will
be
no
use
to
us
if
twenty
such
come
since
you
will
not
visit
them
depend
upon
my
dear
that
when
there
twenty
will
visit
them
mr
bennet
was
so
odd
mixture
quick
parts
sarcastic
humour
reserve
caprice
that
experience
twenty
years
had
been
insufficient
to
make
his
wife
understand
his
character
her
mind
was
less
difficult
to
develop
she
was
woman
mean
understanding
little
information
uncertain
temper
when
she
was
discontented
she
fancied
herself
nervous
business
her
life
was
to
get
her
daughters
married
its
solace
was
visiting
news
chapter
mr
bennet
was
among
earliest
those
who
waited
on
mr
bingley
he
had
always
intended
to
visit
him
though
to
last
always
assuring
his
wife
that
he
not
go
till
evening
after
visit
was
paid
she
had
no
knowledge
was
then
disclosed
in
following
manner
observing
his
daughter
employed
in
trimming
hat
he
suddenly
addressed
her
with
hope
mr
bingley
will
like
lizzy
we
not
in
way
to
know
what
mr
bingley
likes
said
her
mother
resentfully
since
we
not
to
visit
but
you
forget
mamma
said
elizabeth
that
we
shall
meet
him
at
assemblies
that
mrs
long
promised
to
introduce
him
do
not
believe
mrs
long
will
do
any
such
thing
she
has
two
nieces
her
own
she
selfish
hypocritical
woman
no
opinion
her
no
more
said
mr
bennet
glad
to
find
that
you
do
not
depend
on
her
serving
you
mrs
bennet
deigned
not
to
make
any
reply
but
unable
to
contain
herself
began
scolding
one
her
daughters
don
t
keep
coughing
so
kitty
for
heaven
s
sake
little
compassion
on
my
nerves
you
tear
them
to
pieces
kitty
has
no
discretion
in
her
coughs
said
her
father
she
times
them
ill
do
not
cough
for
my
own
amusement
replied
kitty
fretfully
when
your
next
ball
to
be
lizzy
to
morrow
fortnight
aye
so
cried
her
mother
mrs
long
does
not
come
back
till
day
before
so
will
be
impossible
for
her
to
introduce
him
for
she
will
not
know
him
herself
then
my
dear
you
may
advantage
your
friend
introduce
mr
bingley
to
her
impossible
mr
bennet
impossible
when
not
acquainted
with
him
myself
how
can
you
be
so
teasing
honour
your
circumspection
fortnight
s
acquaintance
certainly
very
little
one
cannot
know
what
man
really
by
end
fortnight
but
if
we
do
not
venture
somebody
else
will
after
mrs
long
her
daughters
must
stand
their
chance
therefore
as
she
will
think
an
act
kindness
if
you
decline
office
will
take
on
myself
girls
stared
at
their
father
mrs
bennet
said
only
nonsense
nonsense
what
can
be
meaning
that
emphatic
exclamation
cried
he
do
you
consider
forms
introduction
stress
that
laid
on
them
as
nonsense
cannot
quite
agree
with
you
there
what
say
you
mary
for
you
young
lady
deep
reflection
know
read
great
books
make
extracts
mary
wished
to
say
something
sensible
but
knew
not
how
while
mary
adjusting
her
ideas
he
continued
let
us
return
to
mr
bingley
sick
mr
bingley
cried
his
wife
sorry
to
hear
that
but
why
did
not
you
tell
me
that
before
if
had
known
as
much
morning
certainly
would
not
called
on
him
very
unlucky
but
as
actually
paid
visit
we
cannot
escape
acquaintance
now
astonishment
ladies
was
just
what
he
wished
that
mrs
bennet
perhaps
surpassing
rest
though
when
first
tumult
joy
was
over
she
began
to
declare
that
was
what
she
had
expected
while
how
good
was
in
you
my
dear
mr
bennet
but
knew
persuade
you
at
last
was
sure
you
loved
your
girls
too
well
to
neglect
such
an
acquaintance
well
how
pleased
such
good
joke
too
that
you
gone
morning
never
said
word
about
till
now
now
kitty
you
may
cough
as
much
as
you
choose
said
mr
bennet
as
he
spoke
he
left
room
fatigued
with
raptures
his
wife
what
an
excellent
father
you
girls
said
she
when
door
was
shut
do
not
know
how
you
will
ever
make
him
amends
for
his
kindness
or
me
either
for
that
matter
at
our
time
life
not
so
pleasant
can
tell
you
to
be
making
new
acquaintances
every
day
but
for
your
sakes
we
would
do
anything
lydia
my
love
though
you
youngest
dare
say
mr
bingley
will
dance
with
you
at
next
ball
oh
said
lydia
stoutly
not
afraid
for
though
youngest
m
tallest
rest
evening
was
spent
in
conjecturing
how
soon
he
would
return
mr
bennet
s
visit
determining
when
they
ask
him
to
dinner
chapter
not
that
mrs
bennet
however
with
assistance
her
five
daughters
could
ask
on
subject
was
sufficient
to
draw
from
her
husband
any
satisfactory
description
mr
bingley
they
attacked
him
in
various
ways
with
barefaced
questions
ingenious
suppositions
distant
surmises
but
he
eluded
skill
them
they
were
at
last
obliged
to
accept
hand
intelligence
their
neighbour
lady
lucas
her
report
was
highly
favourable
sir
william
had
been
delighted
with
him
he
was
quite
young
wonderfully
handsome
extremely
agreeable
to
crown
whole
he
meant
to
be
at
next
assembly
with
large
party
nothing
could
be
more
delightful
to
be
fond
dancing
was
certain
step
towards
falling
in
love
very
lively
hopes
mr
bingley
s
heart
were
entertained
if
can
but
see
one
my
daughters
happily
settled
at
netherfield
said
mrs
bennet
to
her
husband
others
equally
well
married
shall
nothing
to
wish
for
in
few
days
mr
bingley
returned
mr
bennet
s
visit
sat
about
ten
minutes
with
him
in
his
library
he
had
entertained
hopes
being
admitted
to
sight
young
ladies
whose
beauty
he
had
heard
much
but
he
saw
only
father
ladies
were
somewhat
more
fortunate
for
they
had
advantage
ascertaining
from
an
upper
window
that
he
wore
blue
coat
rode
black
horse
an
invitation
to
dinner
was
soon
afterwards
dispatched
already
had
mrs
bennet
planned
courses
that
were
to
do
credit
to
her
housekeeping
when
an
answer
arrived
which
deferred
mr
bingley
was
obliged
to
be
in
town
following
day
consequently
unable
to
accept
honour
their
invitation
etc
mrs
bennet
was
quite
disconcerted
she
could
not
imagine
what
business
he
could
in
town
so
soon
after
his
arrival
in
hertfordshire
she
began
to
fear
that
he
might
be
always
flying
about
from
one
place
to
another
never
settled
at
netherfield
as
he
ought
to
be
lady
lucas
quieted
her
fears
little
by
starting
idea
his
being
gone
to
london
only
to
get
large
party
for
ball
report
soon
followed
that
mr
bingley
was
to
bring
twelve
ladies
seven
gentlemen
with
him
to
assembly
girls
grieved
over
such
number
ladies
but
were
comforted
day
before
ball
by
hearing
that
instead
twelve
he
brought
only
six
with
him
from
london
his
five
sisters
cousin
when
party
entered
assembly
room
consisted
only
five
altogether
mr
bingley
his
two
sisters
husband
eldest
another
young
man
mr
bingley
was
good
looking
gentlemanlike
he
had
pleasant
countenance
easy
unaffected
manners
his
sisters
were
fine
women
with
an
air
decided
fashion
his
brother
in
law
mr
hurst
merely
looked
gentleman
but
his
friend
mr
darcy
soon
drew
attention
room
by
his
fine
tall
person
handsome
features
noble
mien
report
which
was
in
general
circulation
within
five
minutes
after
his
entrance
his
having
ten
thousand
year
gentlemen
pronounced
him
to
be
fine
figure
man
ladies
declared
he
was
much
handsomer
than
mr
bingley
he
was
looked
at
with
great
admiration
for
about
half
evening
till
his
manners
gave
disgust
which
turned
tide
his
popularity
for
he
was
discovered
to
be
proud
to
be
above
his
company
above
being
pleased
not
his
large
estate
in
derbyshire
could
then
save
him
from
having
most
forbidding
disagreeable
countenance
being
unworthy
to
be
compared
with
his
friend
mr
bingley
had
soon
made
himself
acquainted
with
principal
people
in
room
he
was
lively
unreserved
danced
every
dance
was
angry
that
ball
closed
so
early
talked
giving
one
himself
at
netherfield
such
amiable
qualities
must
speak
for
themselves
what
contrast
between
him
his
friend
mr
darcy
danced
only
once
with
mrs
hurst
once
with
miss
bingley
declined
being
introduced
to
any
other
lady
spent
rest
evening
in
walking
about
room
speaking
occasionally
to
one
his
own
party
his
character
was
decided
he
was
proudest
most
disagreeable
man
in
world
everybody
hoped
that
he
would
never
come
there
again
amongst
most
violent
against
him
was
mrs
bennet
whose
dislike
his
general
behaviour
was
sharpened
into
particular
resentment
by
his
having
slighted
one
her
daughters
elizabeth
bennet
had
been
obliged
by
scarcity
gentlemen
to
sit
down
for
two
dances
during
part
that
time
mr
darcy
had
been
standing
near
enough
for
her
to
hear
conversation
between
him
mr
bingley
who
came
from
dance
for
few
minutes
to
press
his
friend
to
join
come
darcy
said
he
must
you
dance
hate
to
see
you
standing
about
by
yourself
in
stupid
manner
you
had
much
better
dance
certainly
shall
not
you
know
how
detest
unless
particularly
acquainted
with
my
partner
at
such
an
assembly
as
would
be
insupportable
your
sisters
engaged
there
not
another
woman
in
room
whom
would
not
be
punishment
to
me
to
stand
up
with
would
not
be
so
fastidious
as
you
cried
mr
bingley
for
kingdom
upon
my
honour
never
met
with
so
many
pleasant
girls
in
my
life
as
evening
there
several
them
you
see
uncommonly
pretty
you
dancing
with
only
handsome
girl
in
room
said
mr
darcy
looking
at
eldest
miss
bennet
oh
she
most
beautiful
creature
ever
beheld
but
there
one
her
sisters
sitting
down
just
behind
you
who
very
pretty
dare
say
very
agreeable
do
let
me
ask
my
partner
to
introduce
you
which
do
you
mean
turning
round
he
looked
for
moment
at
elizabeth
till
catching
her
eye
he
withdrew
his
own
coldly
said
she
tolerable
but
not
handsome
enough
to
tempt
me
in
no
humour
at
present
to
give
consequence
to
young
ladies
who
slighted
by
other
men
you
had
better
return
to
your
partner
enjoy
her
smiles
for
you
wasting
your
time
with
me
mr
bingley
followed
his
advice
mr
darcy
walked
off
elizabeth
remained
with
no
very
cordial
feelings
toward
him
she
told
story
however
with
great
spirit
among
her
friends
for
she
had
lively
playful
disposition
which
delighted
in
anything
ridiculous
evening
altogether
passed
off
pleasantly
to
whole
family
mrs
bennet
had
seen
her
eldest
daughter
much
admired
by
netherfield
party
mr
bingley
had
danced
with
her
twice
she
had
been
distinguished
by
his
sisters
jane
was
as
much
gratified
by
as
her
mother
could
be
though
in
quieter
way
elizabeth
felt
jane
s
pleasure
mary
had
heard
herself
mentioned
to
miss
bingley
as
most
accomplished
girl
in
neighbourhood
catherine
lydia
had
been
fortunate
enough
never
to
be
without
partners
which
was
that
they
had
yet
learnt
to
care
for
at
ball
they
returned
therefore
in
good
spirits
to
longbourn
village
where
they
lived
which
they
were
principal
inhabitants
they
found
mr
bennet
still
up
with
book
he
was
regardless
time
on
present
occasion
he
had
good
deal
curiosity
as
to
events
an
evening
which
had
raised
such
splendid
expectations
he
had
rather
hoped
that
his
wife
s
views
on
stranger
would
be
disappointed
but
he
soon
found
out
that
he
had
different
story
to
hear
oh
my
dear
mr
bennet
as
she
entered
room
we
had
most
delightful
evening
most
excellent
ball
wish
you
had
been
there
jane
was
so
admired
nothing
could
be
like
everybody
said
how
well
she
looked
mr
bingley
thought
her
quite
beautiful
danced
with
her
twice
only
think
that
my
dear
he
actually
danced
with
her
twice
she
was
only
creature
in
room
that
he
asked
time
first
he
asked
miss
lucas
was
so
vexed
to
see
him
stand
up
with
her
but
however
he
did
not
admire
her
at
indeed
nobody
can
you
know
he
seemed
quite
struck
with
jane
as
she
was
going
down
dance
so
he
inquired
who
she
was
got
introduced
asked
her
for
two
next
then
two
he
danced
with
miss
king
two
fourth
with
maria
lucas
two
fifth
with
jane
again
two
sixth
with
lizzy
boulanger
if
he
had
had
any
compassion
for
me
cried
her
husband
impatiently
he
would
not
danced
half
so
much
for
god
s
sake
say
no
more
his
partners
o
that
he
had
sprained
his
ankle
in
first
place
oh
my
dear
quite
delighted
with
him
he
so
excessively
handsome
his
sisters
charming
women
never
in
my
life
saw
anything
more
elegant
than
their
dresses
dare
say
lace
upon
mrs
hurst
s
gown
here
she
was
interrupted
again
mr
bennet
protested
against
any
description
finery
she
was
therefore
obliged
to
seek
another
branch
subject
related
with
much
bitterness
spirit
some
exaggeration
shocking
rudeness
mr
darcy
but
can
assure
you
she
added
that
lizzy
does
not
lose
much
by
not
suiting
his
fancy
for
he
most
disagreeable
horrid
man
not
at
worth
pleasing
so
high
so
conceited
that
there
was
no
enduring
him
he
walked
here
he
walked
there
fancying
himself
so
very
great
not
handsome
enough
to
dance
with
wish
you
had
been
there
my
dear
to
given
him
one
your
set
downs
quite
detest
man
chapter
when
jane
elizabeth
were
alone
former
who
had
been
cautious
in
her
praise
mr
bingley
before
expressed
to
her
sister
just
how
very
much
she
admired
him
he
just
what
young
man
ought
to
be
said
she
sensible
good
humoured
lively
never
saw
such
happy
manners
so
much
ease
with
such
perfect
good
breeding
he
also
handsome
replied
elizabeth
which
young
man
ought
likewise
to
be
if
he
possibly
can
his
character
thereby
complete
was
very
much
flattered
by
his
asking
me
to
dance
time
did
not
expect
such
compliment
did
not
you
did
for
you
but
that
one
great
difference
between
us
compliments
always
take
you
by
surprise
me
never
what
could
be
more
natural
than
his
asking
you
again
he
could
not
help
seeing
that
you
were
about
five
times
as
pretty
as
every
other
woman
in
room
no
thanks
to
his
gallantry
for
that
well
he
certainly
very
agreeable
give
you
leave
to
like
him
you
liked
many
stupider
person
dear
lizzy
oh
you
great
deal
too
apt
you
know
to
like
people
in
general
you
never
see
fault
in
anybody
world
good
agreeable
in
your
eyes
never
heard
you
speak
ill
human
being
in
your
life
would
not
wish
to
be
hasty
in
censuring
anyone
but
always
speak
what
think
know
you
do
that
which
makes
wonder
with
your
good
sense
to
be
so
honestly
blind
to
follies
nonsense
others
affectation
candour
common
enough
one
meets
with
everywhere
but
to
be
candid
without
ostentation
or
design
to
take
good
everybody
s
character
make
still
better
say
nothing
bad
belongs
to
you
alone
so
you
like
man
s
sisters
too
do
you
their
manners
not
equal
to
his
certainly
not
at
first
but
they
very
pleasing
women
when
you
converse
with
them
miss
bingley
to
live
with
her
brother
keep
his
house
much
mistaken
if
we
shall
not
find
very
charming
neighbour
in
her
elizabeth
listened
in
silence
but
was
not
convinced
their
behaviour
at
assembly
had
not
been
calculated
to
please
in
general
with
more
quickness
observation
less
pliancy
temper
than
her
sister
with
judgement
too
unassailed
by
any
attention
to
herself
she
was
very
little
disposed
to
approve
them
they
were
in
fact
very
fine
ladies
not
deficient
in
good
humour
when
they
were
pleased
nor
in
power
making
themselves
agreeable
when
they
chose
but
proud
conceited
they
were
rather
handsome
had
been
educated
in
one
first
private
seminaries
in
town
had
fortune
twenty
thousand
pounds
were
in
habit
spending
more
than
they
ought
associating
with
people
rank
were
therefore
in
every
respect
entitled
to
think
well
themselves
meanly
others
they
were
respectable
family
in
north
england
circumstance
more
deeply
impressed
on
their
memories
than
that
their
brother
s
fortune
their
own
had
been
acquired
by
trade
mr
bingley
inherited
property
to
amount
nearly
hundred
thousand
pounds
from
his
father
who
had
intended
to
purchase
an
estate
but
did
not
live
to
do
mr
bingley
intended
likewise
sometimes
made
choice
his
county
but
as
he
was
now
provided
with
good
house
liberty
manor
was
doubtful
to
many
those
who
best
knew
easiness
his
temper
whether
he
might
not
spend
remainder
his
days
at
netherfield
leave
next
generation
to
purchase
his
sisters
were
anxious
for
his
having
an
estate
his
own
but
though
he
was
now
only
established
as
tenant
miss
bingley
was
by
no
means
unwilling
to
preside
at
his
table
nor
was
mrs
hurst
who
had
married
man
more
fashion
than
fortune
less
disposed
to
consider
his
house
as
her
home
when
suited
her
mr
bingley
had
not
been
age
two
years
when
he
was
tempted
by
an
accidental
recommendation
to
look
at
netherfield
house
he
did
look
at
into
for
half
an
hour
was
pleased
with
situation
principal
rooms
satisfied
with
what
owner
said
in
its
praise
took
immediately
between
him
darcy
there
was
very
steady
friendship
in
spite
great
opposition
character
bingley
was
endeared
to
darcy
by
easiness
openness
ductility
his
temper
though
no
disposition
could
offer
greater
contrast
to
his
own
though
with
his
own
he
never
appeared
dissatisfied
on
strength
darcy
s
regard
bingley
had
firmest
reliance
his
judgement
highest
opinion
in
understanding
darcy
was
superior
bingley
was
by
no
means
deficient
but
darcy
was
clever
he
was
at
same
time
haughty
reserved
fastidious
his
manners
though
well
bred
were
not
inviting
in
that
respect
his
friend
had
greatly
advantage
bingley
was
sure
being
liked
wherever
he
appeared
darcy
was
continually
giving
offense
manner
in
which
they
spoke
meryton
assembly
was
sufficiently
characteristic
bingley
had
never
met
with
more
pleasant
people
or
prettier
girls
in
his
life
everybody
had
been
most
kind
attentive
to
him
there
had
been
no
formality
no
stiffness
he
had
soon
felt
acquainted
with
room
as
to
miss
bennet
he
could
not
conceive
an
angel
more
beautiful
darcy
on
contrary
had
seen
collection
people
in
whom
there
was
little
beauty
no
fashion
for
none
whom
he
had
felt
smallest
interest
from
none
received
either
attention
or
pleasure
miss
bennet
he
acknowledged
to
be
pretty
but
she
smiled
too
much
mrs
hurst
her
sister
allowed
to
be
so
but
still
they
admired
her
liked
her
pronounced
her
to
be
sweet
girl
one
whom
they
would
not
object
to
know
more
miss
bennet
was
therefore
established
as
sweet
girl
their
brother
felt
authorized
by
such
commendation
to
think
her
as
he
chose
chapter
within
short
walk
longbourn
lived
family
with
whom
bennets
were
particularly
intimate
sir
william
lucas
had
been
formerly
in
trade
in
meryton
where
he
had
made
tolerable
fortune
risen
to
honour
knighthood
by
an
address
to
king
during
his
mayoralty
distinction
had
perhaps
been
felt
too
strongly
had
given
him
disgust
to
his
business
to
his
residence
in
small
market
town
in
quitting
them
both
he
had
removed
with
his
family
to
house
about
mile
from
meryton
denominated
from
that
period
lucas
lodge
where
he
could
think
with
pleasure
his
own
importance
unshackled
by
business
occupy
himself
solely
in
being
civil
to
world
for
though
elated
by
his
rank
did
not
render
him
supercilious
on
contrary
he
was
attention
to
everybody
by
nature
inoffensive
friendly
obliging
his
presentation
at
st
james
s
had
made
him
courteous
lady
lucas
was
very
good
kind
woman
not
too
clever
to
be
valuable
neighbour
to
mrs
bennet
they
had
several
children
eldest
them
sensible
intelligent
young
woman
about
twenty
seven
was
elizabeth
s
intimate
friend
that
miss
lucases
miss
bennets
meet
to
talk
over
ball
was
absolutely
necessary
morning
after
assembly
brought
former
to
longbourn
to
hear
to
communicate
you
began
evening
well
charlotte
said
mrs
bennet
with
civil
self
command
to
miss
lucas
you
were
mr
bingley
s
first
choice
yes
but
he
seemed
to
like
his
better
oh
you
mean
jane
suppose
because
he
danced
with
her
twice
to
be
sure
that
did
seem
as
if
he
admired
her
indeed
rather
believe
he
did
heard
something
about
but
hardly
know
what
something
about
mr
robinson
perhaps
you
mean
what
overheard
between
him
mr
robinson
did
not
mention
to
you
mr
robinson
s
asking
him
how
he
liked
our
meryton
assemblies
whether
he
did
not
think
there
were
great
many
pretty
women
in
room
which
he
thought
prettiest
his
answering
immediately
to
last
question
oh
eldest
miss
bennet
beyond
doubt
there
cannot
be
two
opinions
on
that
point
upon
my
word
well
that
very
decided
indeed
that
does
seem
as
if
but
however
may
come
to
nothing
you
know
my
overhearings
were
more
to
purpose
than
yours
eliza
said
charlotte
mr
darcy
not
so
well
worth
listening
to
as
his
friend
he
poor
eliza
to
be
only
just
tolerable
beg
you
would
not
put
into
lizzy
s
head
to
be
vexed
by
his
ill
treatment
for
he
such
disagreeable
man
that
would
be
quite
misfortune
to
be
liked
by
him
mrs
long
told
me
last
night
that
he
sat
close
to
her
for
half
an
hour
without
once
opening
his
lips
you
quite
sure
ma
not
there
little
mistake
said
jane
certainly
saw
mr
darcy
speaking
to
her
aye
because
she
asked
him
at
last
how
he
liked
netherfield
he
could
not
help
answering
her
but
she
said
he
seemed
quite
angry
at
being
spoke
to
miss
bingley
told
me
said
jane
that
he
never
speaks
much
unless
among
his
intimate
acquaintances
with
them
he
remarkably
agreeable
do
not
believe
word
my
dear
if
he
had
been
so
very
agreeable
he
would
talked
to
mrs
long
but
can
guess
how
was
everybody
says
that
he
eat
up
with
pride
dare
say
he
had
heard
somehow
that
mrs
long
does
not
keep
carriage
had
come
to
ball
in
hack
chaise
do
not
mind
his
not
talking
to
mrs
long
said
miss
lucas
but
wish
he
had
danced
with
eliza
another
time
lizzy
said
her
mother
would
not
dance
with
him
if
were
you
believe
ma
may
safely
promise
you
never
to
dance
with
him
his
pride
said
miss
lucas
does
not
offend
me
so
much
as
pride
often
does
because
there
an
excuse
for
one
cannot
wonder
that
so
very
fine
young
man
with
family
fortune
everything
in
his
favour
think
highly
himself
if
may
so
express
he
has
right
to
be
proud
that
very
true
replied
elizabeth
could
easily
forgive
his
pride
if
he
had
not
mortified
mine
pride
observed
mary
who
piqued
herself
upon
solidity
her
reflections
very
common
failing
believe
by
that
ever
read
convinced
that
very
common
indeed
that
human
nature
particularly
prone
to
that
there
very
few
us
who
do
not
cherish
feeling
self
complacency
on
score
some
quality
or
other
real
or
imaginary
vanity
pride
different
things
though
words
often
used
synonymously
person
may
be
proud
without
being
vain
pride
relates
more
to
our
opinion
ourselves
vanity
to
what
we
would
others
think
us
if
were
as
rich
as
mr
darcy
cried
young
lucas
who
came
with
his
sisters
not
care
how
proud
was
would
keep
pack
foxhounds
drink
bottle
wine
day
then
you
would
drink
great
deal
more
than
you
ought
said
mrs
bennet
if
were
to
see
you
at
take
away
your
bottle
directly
boy
protested
that
she
not
she
continued
to
declare
that
she
would
argument
ended
only
with
visit
chapter
ladies
longbourn
soon
waited
on
those
netherfield
visit
was
soon
returned
in
due
form
miss
bennet
s
pleasing
manners
grew
on
goodwill
mrs
hurst
miss
bingley
though
mother
was
found
to
be
intolerable
younger
sisters
not
worth
speaking
to
wish
being
better
acquainted
with
them
was
expressed
towards
two
eldest
by
jane
attention
was
received
with
greatest
pleasure
but
elizabeth
still
saw
superciliousness
in
their
treatment
everybody
hardly
excepting
even
her
sister
could
not
like
them
though
their
kindness
to
jane
such
as
was
had
value
as
arising
in
probability
from
influence
their
brother
s
admiration
was
generally
evident
whenever
they
met
that
he
did
admire
her
to
her
was
equally
evident
that
jane
was
yielding
to
preference
which
she
had
begun
to
entertain
for
him
from
first
was
in
way
to
be
very
much
in
love
but
she
considered
with
pleasure
that
was
not
likely
to
be
discovered
by
world
in
general
since
jane
united
with
great
strength
feeling
composure
temper
uniform
cheerfulness
manner
which
would
guard
her
from
suspicions
impertinent
she
mentioned
to
her
friend
miss
lucas
may
perhaps
be
pleasant
replied
charlotte
to
be
able
to
impose
on
public
in
such
case
but
sometimes
disadvantage
to
be
so
very
guarded
if
woman
conceals
her
affection
with
same
skill
from
object
she
may
lose
opportunity
fixing
him
will
then
be
but
poor
consolation
to
believe
world
equally
in
dark
there
so
much
gratitude
or
vanity
in
almost
every
attachment
that
not
safe
to
leave
any
to
itself
we
can
begin
freely
slight
preference
natural
enough
but
there
very
few
us
who
heart
enough
to
be
really
in
love
without
encouragement
in
nine
cases
out
ten
women
had
better
show
more
affection
than
she
feels
bingley
likes
your
sister
undoubtedly
but
he
may
never
do
more
than
like
her
if
she
does
not
help
him
on
but
she
does
help
him
on
as
much
as
her
nature
will
allow
if
can
perceive
her
regard
for
him
he
must
be
simpleton
indeed
not
to
discover
too
remember
eliza
that
he
does
not
know
jane
s
disposition
as
you
do
but
if
woman
partial
to
man
does
not
endeavour
to
conceal
he
must
find
out
perhaps
he
must
if
he
sees
enough
her
but
though
bingley
jane
meet
tolerably
often
never
for
many
hours
together
as
they
always
see
each
other
in
large
mixed
parties
impossible
that
every
moment
be
employed
in
conversing
together
jane
therefore
make
most
every
half
hour
in
which
she
can
command
his
attention
when
she
secure
him
there
will
be
more
leisure
for
falling
in
love
as
much
as
she
chooses
your
plan
good
one
replied
elizabeth
where
nothing
in
question
but
desire
being
well
married
if
were
determined
to
get
rich
husband
or
any
husband
dare
say
adopt
but
these
not
jane
s
feelings
she
not
acting
by
design
as
yet
she
cannot
even
be
certain
degree
her
own
regard
nor
its
reasonableness
she
has
known
him
only
fortnight
she
danced
four
dances
with
him
at
meryton
she
saw
him
one
morning
at
his
own
house
has
since
dined
with
him
in
company
four
times
not
quite
enough
to
make
her
understand
his
character
not
as
you
represent
had
she
merely
dined
with
him
she
might
only
discovered
whether
he
had
good
appetite
but
you
must
remember
that
four
evenings
also
been
spent
together
four
evenings
may
do
great
deal
yes
these
four
evenings
enabled
them
to
ascertain
that
they
both
like
vingt
un
better
than
commerce
but
with
respect
to
any
other
leading
characteristic
do
not
imagine
that
much
has
been
unfolded
well
said
charlotte
wish
jane
success
with
my
heart
if
she
were
married
to
him
to
morrow
think
she
had
as
good
chance
happiness
as
if
she
were
to
be
studying
his
character
for
twelvemonth
happiness
in
marriage
entirely
matter
chance
if
dispositions
parties
ever
so
well
known
to
each
other
or
ever
so
similar
beforehand
does
not
advance
their
felicity
in
least
they
always
continue
to
grow
sufficiently
unlike
afterwards
to
their
share
vexation
better
to
know
as
little
as
possible
defects
person
with
whom
you
to
pass
your
life
you
make
me
laugh
charlotte
but
not
sound
you
know
not
sound
that
you
would
never
act
in
way
yourself
occupied
in
observing
mr
bingley
s
attentions
to
her
sister
elizabeth
was
far
from
suspecting
that
she
was
herself
becoming
an
object
some
interest
in
eyes
his
friend
mr
darcy
had
at
first
scarcely
allowed
her
to
be
pretty
he
had
looked
at
her
without
admiration
at
ball
when
they
next
met
he
looked
at
her
only
to
criticise
but
no
sooner
had
he
made
clear
to
himself
his
friends
that
she
hardly
had
good
feature
in
her
face
than
he
began
to
find
was
rendered
uncommonly
intelligent
by
beautiful
expression
her
dark
eyes
to
discovery
succeeded
some
others
equally
mortifying
though
he
had
detected
with
critical
eye
more
than
one
failure
perfect
symmetry
in
her
form
he
was
forced
to
acknowledge
her
figure
to
be
light
pleasing
in
spite
his
asserting
that
her
manners
were
not
those
fashionable
world
he
was
caught
by
their
easy
playfulness
she
was
perfectly
unaware
to
her
he
was
only
man
who
made
himself
agreeable
nowhere
who
had
not
thought
her
handsome
enough
to
dance
with
he
began
to
wish
to
know
more
her
as
step
towards
conversing
with
her
himself
attended
to
her
conversation
with
others
his
doing
so
drew
her
notice
was
at
sir
william
lucas
s
where
large
party
were
assembled
what
does
mr
darcy
mean
said
she
to
charlotte
by
listening
to
my
conversation
with
colonel
forster
that
question
which
mr
darcy
only
can
answer
but
if
he
does
any
more
shall
certainly
let
him
know
that
see
what
he
about
he
has
very
satirical
eye
if
do
not
begin
by
being
impertinent
myself
shall
soon
grow
afraid
him
on
his
approaching
them
soon
afterwards
though
without
seeming
to
any
intention
speaking
miss
lucas
defied
her
friend
to
mention
such
subject
to
him
which
immediately
provoking
elizabeth
to
do
she
turned
to
him
said
did
you
not
think
mr
darcy
that
expressed
myself
uncommonly
well
just
now
when
was
teasing
colonel
forster
to
give
us
ball
at
meryton
with
great
energy
but
always
subject
which
makes
lady
energetic
you
severe
on
us
will
be
her
turn
soon
to
be
teased
said
miss
lucas
going
to
open
instrument
eliza
you
know
what
follows
you
very
strange
creature
by
way
friend
always
wanting
me
to
play
sing
before
anybody
everybody
if
my
vanity
had
taken
musical
turn
you
would
been
invaluable
but
as
would
really
rather
not
sit
down
before
those
who
must
be
in
habit
hearing
very
best
performers
on
miss
lucas
s
persevering
however
she
added
very
well
if
must
be
so
must
gravely
glancing
at
mr
darcy
there
fine
old
saying
which
everybody
here
course
familiar
with
keep
your
breath
to
cool
your
porridge
shall
keep
mine
to
swell
my
song
her
performance
was
pleasing
though
by
no
means
capital
after
song
or
two
before
she
could
reply
to
entreaties
several
that
she
would
sing
again
she
was
eagerly
succeeded
at
instrument
by
her
sister
mary
who
having
in
consequence
being
only
plain
one
in
family
worked
hard
for
knowledge
accomplishments
was
always
impatient
for
display
mary
had
neither
genius
nor
taste
though
vanity
had
given
her
application
had
given
her
likewise
pedantic
air
conceited
manner
which
would
injured
higher
degree
excellence
than
she
had
reached
elizabeth
easy
unaffected
had
been
listened
to
with
much
more
pleasure
though
not
playing
half
so
well
mary
at
end
long
concerto
was
glad
to
purchase
praise
gratitude
by
scotch
irish
airs
at
request
her
younger
sisters
who
with
some
lucases
two
or
officers
joined
eagerly
in
dancing
at
one
end
room
mr
darcy
stood
near
them
in
silent
indignation
at
such
mode
passing
evening
to
exclusion
conversation
was
too
much
engrossed
by
his
thoughts
to
perceive
that
sir
william
lucas
was
his
neighbour
till
sir
william
thus
began
what
charming
amusement
for
young
people
mr
darcy
there
nothing
like
dancing
after
consider
as
one
first
refinements
polished
society
certainly
sir
has
advantage
also
being
in
vogue
amongst
less
polished
societies
world
every
savage
can
dance
sir
william
only
smiled
your
friend
performs
delightfully
he
continued
after
pause
on
seeing
bingley
join
group
doubt
not
that
you
an
adept
in
science
yourself
mr
darcy
you
saw
me
dance
at
meryton
believe
sir
yes
indeed
received
no
inconsiderable
pleasure
from
sight
do
you
often
dance
at
st
james
s
never
sir
do
you
not
think
would
be
proper
compliment
to
place
compliment
which
never
pay
to
any
place
if
can
avoid
you
house
in
town
conclude
mr
darcy
bowed
had
once
had
some
thought
fixing
in
town
myself
for
fond
superior
society
but
did
not
feel
quite
certain
that
air
london
would
agree
with
lady
lucas
he
paused
in
hopes
an
answer
but
his
companion
was
not
disposed
to
make
any
elizabeth
at
that
instant
moving
towards
them
he
was
struck
with
action
doing
very
gallant
thing
called
out
to
her
my
dear
miss
eliza
why
you
not
dancing
mr
darcy
you
must
allow
me
to
present
young
lady
to
you
as
very
desirable
partner
you
cannot
refuse
to
dance
sure
when
so
much
beauty
before
you
taking
her
hand
he
would
given
to
mr
darcy
who
though
extremely
surprised
was
not
unwilling
to
receive
when
she
instantly
drew
back
said
with
some
discomposure
to
sir
william
indeed
sir
not
least
intention
dancing
entreat
you
not
to
suppose
that
moved
way
in
order
to
beg
for
partner
mr
darcy
with
grave
propriety
requested
to
be
allowed
honour
her
hand
but
in
vain
elizabeth
was
determined
nor
did
sir
william
at
shake
her
purpose
by
his
attempt
at
persuasion
you
excel
so
much
in
dance
miss
eliza
that
cruel
to
deny
me
happiness
seeing
you
though
gentleman
dislikes
amusement
in
general
he
can
no
objection
sure
to
oblige
us
for
one
half
hour
mr
darcy
politeness
said
elizabeth
smiling
he
indeed
but
considering
inducement
my
dear
miss
eliza
we
cannot
wonder
at
his
complaisance
for
who
would
object
to
such
partner
elizabeth
looked
archly
turned
away
her
resistance
had
not
injured
her
with
gentleman
he
was
thinking
her
with
some
complacency
when
thus
accosted
by
miss
bingley
can
guess
subject
your
reverie
imagine
not
you
considering
how
insupportable
would
be
to
pass
many
evenings
in
manner
in
such
society
indeed
quite
your
opinion
was
never
more
annoyed
insipidity
yet
noise
nothingness
yet
self
importance
those
people
what
would
give
to
hear
your
strictures
on
them
you
conjecture
totally
wrong
assure
you
my
mind
was
more
agreeably
engaged
been
meditating
on
very
great
pleasure
which
pair
fine
eyes
in
face
pretty
woman
can
bestow
miss
bingley
immediately
fixed
her
eyes
on
his
face
desired
he
would
tell
her
what
lady
had
credit
inspiring
such
reflections
mr
darcy
replied
with
great
intrepidity
miss
elizabeth
bennet
miss
elizabeth
bennet
repeated
miss
bingley
astonishment
how
long
has
she
been
such
favourite
pray
when
to
wish
you
joy
that
exactly
question
which
expected
you
to
ask
lady
s
imagination
very
rapid
jumps
from
admiration
to
love
from
love
to
matrimony
in
moment
knew
you
would
be
wishing
me
joy
nay
if
you
serious
about
shall
consider
matter
absolutely
settled
you
will
be
having
charming
mother
in
law
indeed
course
she
will
always
be
at
pemberley
with
you
he
listened
to
her
with
perfect
indifference
while
she
chose
to
entertain
herself
in
manner
as
his
composure
convinced
her
that
was
safe
her
wit
flowed
long
chapter
mr
bennet
s
property
consisted
almost
entirely
in
an
estate
two
thousand
year
which
unfortunately
for
his
daughters
was
entailed
in
default
heirs
male
on
distant
relation
their
mother
s
fortune
though
ample
for
her
situation
in
life
could
but
ill
supply
deficiency
his
her
father
had
been
an
attorney
in
meryton
had
left
her
four
thousand
pounds
she
had
sister
married
to
mr
phillips
who
had
been
clerk
to
their
father
succeeded
him
in
business
brother
settled
in
london
in
respectable
line
trade
village
longbourn
was
only
one
mile
from
meryton
most
convenient
distance
for
young
ladies
who
were
usually
tempted
thither
or
four
times
week
to
pay
their
duty
to
their
aunt
to
milliner
s
shop
just
over
way
two
youngest
family
catherine
lydia
were
particularly
frequent
in
these
attentions
their
minds
were
more
vacant
than
their
sisters
when
nothing
better
offered
walk
to
meryton
was
necessary
to
amuse
their
morning
hours
furnish
conversation
for
evening
however
bare
news
country
in
general
might
be
they
always
contrived
to
learn
some
from
their
aunt
at
present
indeed
they
were
well
supplied
both
with
news
happiness
by
recent
arrival
militia
regiment
in
neighbourhood
was
to
remain
whole
winter
meryton
was
headquarters
their
visits
to
mrs
phillips
were
now
productive
most
interesting
intelligence
every
day
added
something
to
their
knowledge
officers
names
connections
their
lodgings
were
not
long
secret
at
length
they
began
to
know
officers
themselves
mr
phillips
visited
them
opened
to
his
nieces
store
felicity
unknown
before
they
could
talk
nothing
but
officers
mr
bingley
s
large
fortune
mention
which
gave
animation
to
their
mother
was
worthless
in
their
eyes
when
opposed
to
regimentals
an
ensign
after
listening
one
morning
to
their
effusions
on
subject
mr
bennet
coolly
observed
from
that
can
collect
by
your
manner
talking
you
must
be
two
silliest
girls
in
country
suspected
some
time
but
now
convinced
catherine
was
disconcerted
made
no
answer
but
lydia
with
perfect
indifference
continued
to
express
her
admiration
captain
carter
her
hope
seeing
him
in
course
day
as
he
was
going
next
morning
to
london
astonished
my
dear
said
mrs
bennet
that
you
be
so
ready
to
think
your
own
children
silly
if
wished
to
think
slightingly
anybody
s
children
not
be
my
own
however
if
my
children
silly
must
hope
to
be
always
sensible
yes
but
as
happens
they
them
very
clever
only
point
flatter
myself
on
which
we
do
not
agree
had
hoped
that
our
sentiments
coincided
in
every
particular
but
must
so
far
differ
from
you
as
to
think
our
two
youngest
daughters
uncommonly
foolish
my
dear
mr
bennet
you
must
not
expect
such
girls
to
sense
their
father
mother
when
they
get
to
our
age
dare
say
they
will
not
think
about
officers
any
more
than
we
do
remember
time
when
liked
red
coat
myself
very
well
indeed
so
do
still
at
my
heart
if
smart
young
colonel
with
five
or
six
thousand
year
want
one
my
girls
shall
not
say
nay
to
him
thought
colonel
forster
looked
very
becoming
other
night
at
sir
william
s
in
his
regimentals
mamma
cried
lydia
my
aunt
says
that
colonel
forster
captain
carter
do
not
go
so
often
to
miss
watson
s
as
they
did
when
they
first
came
she
sees
them
now
very
often
standing
in
clarke
s
library
mrs
bennet
was
prevented
replying
by
entrance
footman
with
note
for
miss
bennet
came
from
netherfield
servant
waited
for
an
answer
mrs
bennet
s
eyes
sparkled
with
pleasure
she
was
eagerly
calling
out
while
her
daughter
read
well
jane
who
from
what
about
what
does
he
say
well
jane
make
haste
tell
us
make
haste
my
love
from
miss
bingley
said
jane
then
read
aloud
my
dear
friend
if
you
not
so
compassionate
as
to
dine
to
day
with
louisa
me
we
shall
be
in
danger
hating
each
other
for
rest
our
lives
for
whole
day
s
tete
tete
between
two
women
can
never
end
without
quarrel
come
as
soon
as
you
can
on
receipt
my
brother
gentlemen
to
dine
with
officers
yours
ever
caroline
bingley
with
officers
cried
lydia
wonder
my
aunt
did
not
tell
us
that
dining
out
said
mrs
bennet
that
very
unlucky
can
carriage
said
jane
no
my
dear
you
had
better
go
on
horseback
because
seems
likely
to
rain
then
you
must
stay
night
that
would
be
good
scheme
said
elizabeth
if
you
were
sure
that
they
would
not
offer
to
send
her
home
oh
but
gentlemen
will
mr
bingley
s
chaise
to
go
to
meryton
hursts
no
horses
to
theirs
had
much
rather
go
in
coach
but
my
dear
your
father
cannot
spare
horses
sure
they
wanted
in
farm
mr
bennet
they
not
they
wanted
in
farm
much
oftener
than
can
get
them
but
if
you
got
them
to
day
said
elizabeth
my
mother
s
purpose
will
be
answered
she
did
at
last
extort
from
her
father
an
acknowledgment
that
horses
were
engaged
jane
was
therefore
obliged
to
go
on
horseback
her
mother
attended
her
to
door
with
many
cheerful
prognostics
bad
day
her
hopes
were
answered
jane
had
not
been
gone
long
before
rained
hard
her
sisters
were
uneasy
for
her
but
her
mother
was
delighted
rain
continued
whole
evening
without
intermission
jane
certainly
could
not
come
back
was
lucky
idea
mine
indeed
said
mrs
bennet
more
than
once
as
if
credit
making
rain
were
her
own
till
next
morning
however
she
was
not
aware
felicity
her
contrivance
breakfast
was
scarcely
over
when
servant
from
netherfield
brought
following
note
for
elizabeth
my
dearest
lizzy
find
myself
very
unwell
morning
which
suppose
to
be
imputed
to
my
getting
wet
through
yesterday
my
kind
friends
will
not
hear
my
returning
till
better
they
insist
also
on
my
seeing
mr
jones
therefore
do
not
be
alarmed
if
you
hear
his
having
been
to
me
excepting
sore
throat
headache
there
not
much
matter
with
me
yours
etc
well
my
dear
said
mr
bennet
when
elizabeth
had
read
note
aloud
if
your
daughter
dangerous
fit
illness
if
she
die
would
be
comfort
to
know
that
was
in
pursuit
mr
bingley
under
your
orders
oh
not
afraid
her
dying
people
do
not
die
little
trifling
colds
she
will
be
taken
good
care
as
long
as
she
stays
there
very
well
would
go
see
her
if
could
carriage
elizabeth
feeling
really
anxious
was
determined
to
go
to
her
though
carriage
was
not
to
be
had
as
she
was
no
horsewoman
walking
was
her
only
alternative
she
declared
her
resolution
how
can
you
be
so
silly
cried
her
mother
as
to
think
such
thing
in
dirt
you
will
not
be
fit
to
be
seen
when
you
get
there
shall
be
very
fit
to
see
jane
which
want
hint
to
me
lizzy
said
her
father
to
send
for
horses
no
indeed
do
not
wish
to
avoid
walk
distance
nothing
when
one
has
motive
only
miles
shall
be
back
by
dinner
admire
activity
your
benevolence
observed
mary
but
every
impulse
feeling
be
guided
by
reason
in
my
opinion
exertion
always
be
in
proportion
to
what
required
we
will
go
as
far
as
meryton
with
you
said
catherine
lydia
elizabeth
accepted
their
company
young
ladies
set
off
together
if
we
make
haste
said
lydia
as
they
walked
along
perhaps
we
may
see
something
captain
carter
before
he
goes
in
meryton
they
parted
two
youngest
repaired
to
lodgings
one
officers
wives
elizabeth
continued
her
walk
alone
crossing
field
after
field
at
quick
pace
jumping
over
stiles
springing
over
puddles
with
impatient
activity
finding
herself
at
last
within
view
house
with
weary
ankles
dirty
stockings
face
glowing
with
warmth
exercise
she
was
shown
into
breakfast
parlour
where
but
jane
were
assembled
where
her
appearance
created
great
deal
surprise
that
she
walked
miles
so
early
in
day
in
such
dirty
weather
by
herself
was
almost
incredible
to
mrs
hurst
miss
bingley
elizabeth
was
convinced
that
they
held
her
in
contempt
for
she
was
received
however
very
politely
by
them
in
their
brother
s
manners
there
was
something
better
than
politeness
there
was
good
humour
kindness
mr
darcy
said
very
little
mr
hurst
nothing
at
former
was
divided
between
admiration
brilliancy
which
exercise
had
given
to
her
complexion
doubt
as
to
occasion
s
justifying
her
coming
so
far
alone
latter
was
thinking
only
his
breakfast
her
inquiries
after
her
sister
were
not
very
favourably
answered
miss
bennet
had
slept
ill
though
up
was
very
feverish
not
well
enough
to
leave
her
room
elizabeth
was
glad
to
be
taken
to
her
immediately
jane
who
had
only
been
withheld
by
fear
giving
alarm
or
inconvenience
from
expressing
in
her
note
how
much
she
longed
for
such
visit
was
delighted
at
her
entrance
she
was
not
equal
however
to
much
conversation
when
miss
bingley
left
them
together
could
attempt
little
besides
expressions
gratitude
for
extraordinary
kindness
she
was
treated
with
elizabeth
silently
attended
her
when
breakfast
was
over
they
were
joined
by
sisters
elizabeth
began
to
like
them
herself
when
she
saw
how
much
affection
solicitude
they
showed
for
jane
apothecary
came
having
examined
his
patient
said
as
might
be
supposed
that
she
had
caught
violent
cold
that
they
must
endeavour
to
get
better
advised
her
to
return
to
bed
promised
her
some
draughts
advice
was
followed
readily
for
feverish
symptoms
increased
her
head
ached
acutely
elizabeth
did
not
quit
her
room
for
moment
nor
were
other
ladies
often
absent
gentlemen
being
out
they
had
in
fact
nothing
to
do
elsewhere
when
clock
struck
elizabeth
felt
that
she
must
go
very
unwillingly
said
so
miss
bingley
offered
her
carriage
she
only
wanted
little
pressing
to
accept
when
jane
testified
such
concern
in
parting
with
her
that
miss
bingley
was
obliged
to
convert
offer
chaise
to
an
invitation
to
remain
at
netherfield
for
present
elizabeth
most
thankfully
consented
servant
was
dispatched
to
longbourn
to
acquaint
family
with
her
stay
bring
back
supply
clothes
chapter
at
five
o
clock
two
ladies
retired
to
dress
at
half
past
six
elizabeth
was
summoned
to
dinner
to
civil
inquiries
which
then
poured
in
amongst
which
she
had
pleasure
distinguishing
much
superior
solicitude
mr
bingley
s
she
could
not
make
very
favourable
answer
jane
was
by
no
means
better
sisters
on
hearing
repeated
or
four
times
how
much
they
were
grieved
how
shocking
was
to
bad
cold
how
excessively
they
disliked
being
ill
themselves
then
thought
no
more
matter
their
indifference
towards
jane
when
not
immediately
before
them
restored
elizabeth
to
enjoyment
her
former
dislike
their
brother
indeed
was
only
one
party
whom
she
could
regard
with
any
complacency
his
anxiety
for
jane
was
evident
his
attentions
to
herself
most
pleasing
they
prevented
her
feeling
herself
so
much
an
intruder
as
she
believed
she
was
considered
by
others
she
had
very
little
notice
from
any
but
him
miss
bingley
was
engrossed
by
mr
darcy
her
sister
scarcely
less
so
as
for
mr
hurst
by
whom
elizabeth
sat
he
was
an
indolent
man
who
lived
only
to
eat
drink
play
at
cards
who
when
he
found
her
to
prefer
plain
dish
to
ragout
had
nothing
to
say
to
her
when
dinner
was
over
she
returned
directly
to
jane
miss
bingley
began
abusing
her
as
soon
as
she
was
out
room
her
manners
were
pronounced
to
be
very
bad
indeed
mixture
pride
impertinence
she
had
no
conversation
no
style
no
beauty
mrs
hurst
thought
same
added
she
has
nothing
in
short
to
recommend
her
but
being
an
excellent
walker
shall
never
forget
her
appearance
morning
she
really
looked
almost
wild
she
did
indeed
louisa
could
hardly
keep
my
countenance
very
nonsensical
to
come
at
why
must
she
be
scampering
about
country
because
her
sister
had
cold
her
hair
so
untidy
so
blowsy
yes
her
petticoat
hope
you
saw
her
petticoat
six
inches
deep
in
mud
absolutely
certain
gown
which
had
been
let
down
to
hide
not
doing
its
office
your
picture
may
be
very
exact
louisa
said
bingley
but
was
lost
upon
me
thought
miss
elizabeth
bennet
looked
remarkably
well
when
she
came
into
room
morning
her
dirty
petticoat
quite
escaped
my
notice
you
observed
mr
darcy
sure
said
miss
bingley
inclined
to
think
that
you
would
not
wish
to
see
your
sister
make
such
an
exhibition
certainly
not
to
walk
miles
or
four
miles
or
five
miles
or
whatever
above
her
ankles
in
dirt
alone
quite
alone
what
could
she
mean
by
seems
to
me
to
show
an
abominable
sort
conceited
independence
most
country
town
indifference
to
decorum
shows
an
affection
for
her
sister
that
very
pleasing
said
bingley
afraid
mr
darcy
observed
miss
bingley
in
half
whisper
that
adventure
has
rather
affected
your
admiration
her
fine
eyes
not
at
he
replied
they
were
brightened
by
exercise
short
pause
followed
speech
mrs
hurst
began
again
excessive
regard
for
miss
jane
bennet
she
really
very
sweet
girl
wish
with
my
heart
she
were
well
settled
but
with
such
father
mother
such
low
connections
afraid
there
no
chance
think
heard
you
say
that
their
uncle
an
attorney
on
meryton
yes
they
another
who
lives
somewhere
near
cheapside
that
capital
added
her
sister
they
both
laughed
heartily
if
they
had
uncles
enough
to
fill
cheapside
cried
bingley
would
not
make
them
one
jot
less
agreeable
but
must
very
materially
lessen
their
chance
marrying
men
any
consideration
in
world
replied
darcy
to
speech
bingley
made
no
answer
but
his
sisters
gave
their
hearty
assent
indulged
their
mirth
for
some
time
at
expense
their
dear
friend
s
vulgar
relations
with
renewal
tenderness
however
they
returned
to
her
room
on
leaving
dining
parlour
sat
with
her
till
summoned
to
coffee
she
was
still
very
poorly
elizabeth
would
not
quit
her
at
till
late
in
evening
when
she
had
comfort
seeing
her
sleep
when
seemed
to
her
rather
right
than
pleasant
that
she
go
downstairs
herself
on
entering
drawing
room
she
found
whole
party
at
loo
was
immediately
invited
to
join
them
but
suspecting
them
to
be
playing
high
she
declined
making
her
sister
excuse
said
she
would
amuse
herself
for
short
time
she
could
stay
below
with
book
mr
hurst
looked
at
her
with
astonishment
do
you
prefer
reading
to
cards
said
he
that
rather
singular
miss
eliza
bennet
said
miss
bingley
despises
cards
she
great
reader
has
no
pleasure
in
anything
else
deserve
neither
such
praise
nor
such
censure
cried
elizabeth
not
great
reader
pleasure
in
many
things
in
nursing
your
sister
sure
you
pleasure
said
bingley
hope
will
be
soon
increased
by
seeing
her
quite
well
elizabeth
thanked
him
from
her
heart
then
walked
towards
table
where
few
books
were
lying
he
immediately
offered
to
fetch
her
others
that
his
library
afforded
wish
my
collection
were
larger
for
your
benefit
my
own
credit
but
an
idle
fellow
though
not
many
more
than
ever
looked
into
elizabeth
assured
him
that
she
could
suit
herself
perfectly
with
those
in
room
astonished
said
miss
bingley
that
my
father
left
so
small
collection
books
what
delightful
library
you
at
pemberley
mr
darcy
ought
to
be
good
he
replied
has
been
work
many
generations
then
you
added
so
much
to
yourself
you
always
buying
books
cannot
comprehend
neglect
family
library
in
such
days
as
these
neglect
sure
you
neglect
nothing
that
can
add
to
beauties
that
noble
place
charles
when
you
build
your
house
wish
may
be
half
as
delightful
as
pemberley
wish
may
but
would
really
advise
you
to
make
your
purchase
in
that
neighbourhood
take
pemberley
for
kind
model
there
not
finer
county
in
england
than
derbyshire
with
my
heart
will
buy
pemberley
itself
if
darcy
will
sell
talking
possibilities
charles
upon
my
word
caroline
think
more
possible
to
get
pemberley
by
purchase
than
by
imitation
elizabeth
was
so
much
caught
with
what
passed
as
to
leave
her
very
little
attention
for
her
book
soon
laying
wholly
aside
she
drew
near
card
table
stationed
herself
between
mr
bingley
his
eldest
sister
to
observe
game
miss
darcy
much
grown
since
spring
said
miss
bingley
will
she
be
as
tall
as
think
she
will
she
now
about
miss
elizabeth
bennet
s
height
or
rather
taller
how
long
to
see
her
again
never
met
with
anybody
who
delighted
me
so
much
such
countenance
such
manners
so
extremely
accomplished
for
her
age
her
performance
on
pianoforte
exquisite
amazing
to
me
said
bingley
how
young
ladies
can
patience
to
be
so
very
accomplished
as
they
young
ladies
accomplished
my
dear
charles
what
do
you
mean
yes
them
think
they
paint
tables
cover
screens
net
purses
scarcely
know
anyone
who
cannot
do
sure
never
heard
young
lady
spoken
for
first
time
without
being
informed
that
she
was
very
accomplished
your
list
common
extent
accomplishments
said
darcy
has
too
much
truth
word
applied
to
many
woman
who
deserves
no
otherwise
than
by
netting
purse
or
covering
screen
but
very
far
from
agreeing
with
you
in
your
estimation
ladies
in
general
cannot
boast
knowing
more
than
half
dozen
in
whole
range
my
acquaintance
that
really
accomplished
nor
sure
said
miss
bingley
then
observed
elizabeth
you
must
comprehend
great
deal
in
your
idea
an
accomplished
woman
yes
do
comprehend
great
deal
in
oh
certainly
cried
his
faithful
assistant
no
one
can
be
really
esteemed
accomplished
who
does
not
greatly
surpass
what
usually
met
with
woman
must
thorough
knowledge
music
singing
drawing
dancing
modern
languages
to
deserve
word
besides
she
must
possess
certain
something
in
her
air
manner
walking
tone
her
voice
her
address
expressions
or
word
will
be
but
half
deserved
she
must
possess
added
darcy
to
she
must
yet
add
something
more
substantial
in
improvement
her
mind
by
extensive
reading
no
longer
surprised
at
your
knowing
only
six
accomplished
women
rather
wonder
now
at
your
knowing
any
you
so
severe
upon
your
own
sex
as
to
doubt
possibility
never
saw
such
woman
never
saw
such
capacity
taste
application
elegance
as
you
describe
united
mrs
hurst
miss
bingley
both
cried
out
against
injustice
her
implied
doubt
were
both
protesting
that
they
knew
many
women
who
answered
description
when
mr
hurst
called
them
to
order
with
bitter
complaints
their
inattention
to
what
was
going
forward
as
conversation
was
thereby
at
an
end
elizabeth
soon
afterwards
left
room
elizabeth
bennet
said
miss
bingley
when
door
was
closed
on
her
one
those
young
ladies
who
seek
to
recommend
themselves
to
other
sex
by
undervaluing
their
own
with
many
men
dare
say
succeeds
but
in
my
opinion
paltry
device
very
mean
art
undoubtedly
replied
darcy
to
whom
remark
was
chiefly
addressed
there
meanness
in
arts
which
ladies
sometimes
condescend
to
employ
for
captivation
whatever
bears
affinity
to
cunning
despicable
miss
bingley
was
not
so
entirely
satisfied
with
reply
as
to
continue
subject
elizabeth
joined
them
again
only
to
say
that
her
sister
was
worse
that
she
could
not
leave
her
bingley
urged
mr
jones
being
sent
for
immediately
while
his
sisters
convinced
that
no
country
advice
could
be
any
service
recommended
an
express
to
town
for
one
most
eminent
physicians
she
would
not
hear
but
she
was
not
so
unwilling
to
comply
with
their
brother
s
proposal
was
settled
that
mr
jones
be
sent
for
early
in
morning
if
miss
bennet
were
not
decidedly
better
bingley
was
quite
uncomfortable
his
sisters
declared
that
they
were
miserable
they
solaced
their
wretchedness
however
by
duets
after
supper
while
he
could
find
no
better
relief
to
his
feelings
than
by
giving
his
housekeeper
directions
that
every
attention
might
be
paid
to
sick
lady
her
sister
chapter
elizabeth
passed
chief
night
in
her
sister
s
room
in
morning
had
pleasure
being
able
to
send
tolerable
answer
to
inquiries
which
she
very
early
received
from
mr
bingley
by
housemaid
some
time
afterwards
from
two
elegant
ladies
who
waited
on
his
sisters
in
spite
amendment
however
she
requested
to
note
sent
to
longbourn
desiring
her
mother
to
visit
jane
form
her
own
judgement
her
situation
note
was
immediately
dispatched
its
contents
as
quickly
complied
with
mrs
bennet
accompanied
by
her
two
youngest
girls
reached
netherfield
soon
after
family
breakfast
had
she
found
jane
in
any
apparent
danger
mrs
bennet
would
been
very
miserable
but
being
satisfied
on
seeing
her
that
her
illness
was
not
alarming
she
had
no
wish
her
recovering
immediately
as
her
restoration
to
health
would
probably
remove
her
from
netherfield
she
would
not
listen
therefore
to
her
daughter
s
proposal
being
carried
home
neither
did
apothecary
who
arrived
about
same
time
think
at
advisable
after
sitting
little
while
with
jane
on
miss
bingley
s
appearance
invitation
mother
daughter
attended
her
into
breakfast
parlour
bingley
met
them
with
hopes
that
mrs
bennet
had
not
found
miss
bennet
worse
than
she
expected
indeed
sir
was
her
answer
she
great
deal
too
ill
to
be
moved
mr
jones
says
we
must
not
think
moving
her
we
must
trespass
little
longer
on
your
kindness
removed
cried
bingley
must
not
be
thought
my
sister
sure
will
not
hear
her
removal
you
may
depend
upon
madam
said
miss
bingley
with
cold
civility
that
miss
bennet
will
receive
every
possible
attention
while
she
remains
with
us
mrs
bennet
was
profuse
in
her
acknowledgments
sure
she
added
if
was
not
for
such
good
friends
do
not
know
what
would
become
her
for
she
very
ill
indeed
suffers
vast
deal
though
with
greatest
patience
in
world
which
always
way
with
her
for
she
has
without
exception
sweetest
temper
ever
met
with
often
tell
my
other
girls
they
nothing
to
her
you
sweet
room
here
mr
bingley
charming
prospect
over
gravel
walk
do
not
know
place
in
country
that
equal
to
netherfield
you
will
not
think
quitting
in
hurry
hope
though
you
but
short
lease
whatever
do
done
in
hurry
replied
he
therefore
if
resolve
to
quit
netherfield
probably
be
off
in
five
minutes
at
present
however
consider
myself
as
quite
fixed
here
that
exactly
what
supposed
you
said
elizabeth
you
begin
to
comprehend
me
do
you
cried
he
turning
towards
her
oh
yes
understand
you
perfectly
wish
might
take
for
compliment
but
to
be
so
easily
seen
through
afraid
pitiful
that
as
happens
does
not
follow
that
deep
intricate
character
more
or
less
estimable
than
such
one
as
yours
lizzy
cried
her
mother
remember
where
you
do
not
run
on
in
wild
manner
that
you
suffered
to
do
at
home
did
not
know
before
continued
bingley
immediately
that
you
were
studier
character
must
be
an
amusing
study
yes
but
intricate
characters
most
amusing
they
at
least
that
advantage
country
said
darcy
can
in
general
supply
but
few
subjects
for
such
study
in
country
neighbourhood
you
move
in
very
confined
unvarying
society
but
people
themselves
alter
so
much
that
there
something
new
to
be
observed
in
them
for
ever
yes
indeed
cried
mrs
bennet
offended
by
his
manner
mentioning
country
neighbourhood
assure
you
there
quite
as
much
that
going
on
in
country
as
in
town
everybody
was
surprised
darcy
after
looking
at
her
for
moment
turned
silently
away
mrs
bennet
who
fancied
she
had
gained
complete
victory
over
him
continued
her
triumph
cannot
see
that
london
has
any
great
advantage
over
country
for
my
part
except
shops
public
places
country
vast
deal
pleasanter
not
mr
bingley
when
in
country
he
replied
never
wish
to
leave
when
in
town
pretty
much
same
they
each
their
advantages
can
be
equally
happy
in
either
aye
that
because
you
right
disposition
but
that
gentleman
looking
at
darcy
seemed
to
think
country
was
nothing
at
indeed
mamma
you
mistaken
said
elizabeth
blushing
for
her
mother
you
quite
mistook
mr
darcy
he
only
meant
that
there
was
not
such
variety
people
to
be
met
with
in
country
as
in
town
which
you
must
acknowledge
to
be
true
certainly
my
dear
nobody
said
there
were
but
as
to
not
meeting
with
many
people
in
neighbourhood
believe
there
few
neighbourhoods
larger
know
we
dine
with
four
twenty
families
nothing
but
concern
for
elizabeth
could
enable
bingley
to
keep
his
countenance
his
sister
was
less
delicate
directed
her
eyes
towards
mr
darcy
with
very
expressive
smile
elizabeth
for
sake
saying
something
that
might
turn
her
mother
s
thoughts
now
asked
her
if
charlotte
lucas
had
been
at
longbourn
since
her
coming
away
yes
she
called
yesterday
with
her
father
what
an
agreeable
man
sir
william
mr
bingley
not
he
so
much
man
fashion
so
genteel
easy
he
had
always
something
to
say
to
everybody
that
my
idea
good
breeding
those
persons
who
fancy
themselves
very
important
never
open
their
mouths
quite
mistake
matter
did
charlotte
dine
with
you
no
she
would
go
home
fancy
she
was
wanted
about
mince
pies
for
my
part
mr
bingley
always
keep
servants
that
can
do
their
own
work
my
daughters
brought
up
very
differently
but
everybody
to
judge
for
themselves
lucases
very
good
sort
girls
assure
you
pity
they
not
handsome
not
that
think
charlotte
so
very
plain
but
then
she
our
particular
friend
she
seems
very
pleasant
young
woman
oh
dear
yes
but
you
must
own
she
very
plain
lady
lucas
herself
has
often
said
so
envied
me
jane
s
beauty
do
not
like
to
boast
my
own
child
but
to
be
sure
jane
one
does
not
often
see
anybody
better
looking
what
everybody
says
do
not
trust
my
own
partiality
when
she
was
only
fifteen
there
was
man
at
my
brother
gardiner
s
in
town
so
much
in
love
with
her
that
my
sister
in
law
was
sure
he
would
make
her
an
offer
before
we
came
away
but
however
he
did
not
perhaps
he
thought
her
too
young
however
he
wrote
some
verses
on
her
very
pretty
they
were
so
ended
his
affection
said
elizabeth
impatiently
there
has
been
many
one
fancy
overcome
in
same
way
wonder
who
first
discovered
efficacy
poetry
in
driving
away
love
been
used
to
consider
poetry
as
food
love
said
darcy
fine
stout
healthy
love
may
everything
nourishes
what
strong
already
but
if
be
only
slight
thin
sort
inclination
convinced
that
one
good
sonnet
will
starve
entirely
away
darcy
only
smiled
general
pause
which
ensued
made
elizabeth
tremble
lest
her
mother
be
exposing
herself
again
she
longed
to
speak
but
could
think
nothing
to
say
after
short
silence
mrs
bennet
began
repeating
her
thanks
to
mr
bingley
for
his
kindness
to
jane
with
an
apology
for
troubling
him
also
with
lizzy
mr
bingley
was
unaffectedly
civil
in
his
answer
forced
his
younger
sister
to
be
civil
also
say
what
occasion
required
she
performed
her
part
indeed
without
much
graciousness
but
mrs
bennet
was
satisfied
soon
afterwards
ordered
her
carriage
upon
signal
youngest
her
daughters
put
herself
forward
two
girls
had
been
whispering
to
each
other
during
whole
visit
result
was
that
youngest
tax
mr
bingley
with
having
promised
on
his
first
coming
into
country
to
give
ball
at
netherfield
lydia
was
stout
well
grown
girl
fifteen
with
fine
complexion
good
humoured
countenance
favourite
with
her
mother
whose
affection
had
brought
her
into
public
at
an
early
age
she
had
high
animal
spirits
sort
natural
self
consequence
which
attention
officers
to
whom
her
uncle
s
good
dinners
her
own
easy
manners
recommended
her
had
increased
into
assurance
she
was
very
equal
therefore
to
address
mr
bingley
on
subject
ball
abruptly
reminded
him
his
promise
adding
that
would
be
most
shameful
thing
in
world
if
he
did
not
keep
his
answer
to
sudden
attack
was
delightful
to
their
mother
s
ear
perfectly
ready
assure
you
to
keep
my
engagement
when
your
sister
recovered
you
shall
if
you
please
name
very
day
ball
but
you
would
not
wish
to
be
dancing
when
she
ill
lydia
declared
herself
satisfied
oh
yes
would
be
much
better
to
wait
till
jane
was
well
by
that
time
most
likely
captain
carter
would
be
at
meryton
again
when
you
given
your
ball
she
added
shall
insist
on
their
giving
one
also
shall
tell
colonel
forster
will
be
quite
shame
if
he
does
not
mrs
bennet
her
daughters
then
departed
elizabeth
returned
instantly
to
jane
leaving
her
own
her
relations
behaviour
to
remarks
two
ladies
mr
darcy
latter
whom
however
could
not
be
prevailed
on
to
join
in
their
censure
her
in
spite
miss
bingley
s
witticisms
on
fine
eyes
chapter
day
passed
much
as
day
before
had
done
mrs
hurst
miss
bingley
had
spent
some
hours
morning
with
invalid
who
continued
though
slowly
to
mend
in
evening
elizabeth
joined
their
party
in
drawing
room
loo
table
however
did
not
appear
mr
darcy
was
writing
miss
bingley
seated
near
him
was
watching
progress
his
letter
repeatedly
calling
off
his
attention
by
messages
to
his
sister
mr
hurst
mr
bingley
were
at
piquet
mrs
hurst
was
observing
their
game
elizabeth
took
up
some
needlework
was
sufficiently
amused
in
attending
to
what
passed
between
darcy
his
companion
perpetual
commendations
lady
either
on
his
handwriting
or
on
evenness
his
lines
or
on
length
his
letter
with
perfect
unconcern
with
which
her
praises
were
received
formed
curious
dialogue
was
exactly
in
union
with
her
opinion
each
how
delighted
miss
darcy
will
be
to
receive
such
letter
he
made
no
answer
you
write
uncommonly
fast
you
mistaken
write
rather
slowly
how
many
letters
you
must
occasion
to
write
in
course
year
letters
business
too
how
odious
think
them
fortunate
then
that
they
fall
to
my
lot
instead
yours
pray
tell
your
sister
that
long
to
see
her
already
told
her
so
once
by
your
desire
afraid
you
do
not
like
your
pen
let
me
mend
for
you
mend
pens
remarkably
well
thank
you
but
always
mend
my
own
how
can
you
contrive
to
write
so
even
he
was
silent
tell
your
sister
delighted
to
hear
her
improvement
on
harp
pray
let
her
know
that
quite
in
raptures
with
her
beautiful
little
design
for
table
think
infinitely
superior
to
miss
grantley
s
will
you
give
me
leave
to
defer
your
raptures
till
write
again
at
present
not
room
to
do
them
justice
oh
no
consequence
shall
see
her
in
january
but
do
you
always
write
such
charming
long
letters
to
her
mr
darcy
they
generally
long
but
whether
always
charming
not
for
me
to
determine
rule
with
me
that
person
who
can
write
long
letter
with
ease
cannot
write
ill
that
will
not
do
for
compliment
to
darcy
caroline
cried
her
brother
because
he
does
not
write
with
ease
he
studies
too
much
for
words
four
syllables
do
not
you
darcy
my
style
writing
very
different
from
yours
oh
cried
miss
bingley
charles
writes
in
most
careless
way
imaginable
he
leaves
out
half
his
words
blots
rest
my
ideas
flow
so
rapidly
that
not
time
to
express
them
by
which
means
my
letters
sometimes
convey
no
ideas
at
to
my
correspondents
your
humility
mr
bingley
said
elizabeth
must
disarm
reproof
nothing
more
deceitful
said
darcy
than
appearance
humility
often
only
carelessness
opinion
sometimes
an
indirect
boast
which
two
do
you
call
my
little
recent
piece
modesty
indirect
boast
for
you
really
proud
your
defects
in
writing
because
you
consider
them
as
proceeding
from
rapidity
thought
carelessness
execution
which
if
not
estimable
you
think
at
least
highly
interesting
power
doing
anything
with
quickness
always
prized
much
by
possessor
often
without
any
attention
to
imperfection
performance
when
you
told
mrs
bennet
morning
that
if
you
ever
resolved
upon
quitting
netherfield
you
be
gone
in
five
minutes
you
meant
to
be
sort
panegyric
compliment
to
yourself
yet
what
there
so
very
laudable
in
precipitance
which
must
leave
very
necessary
business
undone
can
be
no
real
advantage
to
yourself
or
anyone
else
nay
cried
bingley
too
much
to
remember
at
night
foolish
things
that
were
said
in
morning
yet
upon
my
honour
believe
what
said
myself
to
be
true
believe
at
moment
at
least
therefore
did
not
assume
character
needless
precipitance
merely
to
show
off
before
ladies
dare
say
you
believed
but
by
no
means
convinced
that
you
would
be
gone
with
such
celerity
your
conduct
would
be
quite
as
dependent
on
chance
as
that
any
man
know
if
as
you
were
mounting
your
horse
friend
were
to
say
bingley
you
had
better
stay
till
next
week
you
would
probably
do
you
would
probably
not
go
at
another
word
might
stay
month
you
only
proved
by
cried
elizabeth
that
mr
bingley
did
not
do
justice
to
his
own
disposition
you
shown
him
off
now
much
more
than
he
did
himself
exceedingly
gratified
said
bingley
by
your
converting
what
my
friend
says
into
compliment
on
sweetness
my
temper
but
afraid
you
giving
turn
which
that
gentleman
did
by
no
means
intend
for
he
would
certainly
think
better
me
if
under
such
circumstance
were
to
give
flat
denial
ride
off
as
fast
as
could
would
mr
darcy
then
consider
rashness
your
original
intentions
as
atoned
for
by
your
obstinacy
in
adhering
to
upon
my
word
cannot
exactly
explain
matter
darcy
must
speak
for
himself
you
expect
me
to
account
for
opinions
which
you
choose
to
call
mine
but
which
never
acknowledged
allowing
case
however
to
stand
according
to
your
representation
you
must
remember
miss
bennet
that
friend
who
supposed
to
desire
his
return
to
house
delay
his
plan
has
merely
desired
asked
without
offering
one
argument
in
favour
its
propriety
to
yield
readily
easily
to
persuasion
friend
no
merit
with
you
to
yield
without
conviction
no
compliment
to
understanding
either
you
appear
to
me
mr
darcy
to
allow
nothing
for
influence
friendship
affection
regard
for
requester
would
often
make
one
readily
yield
to
request
without
waiting
for
arguments
to
reason
one
into
not
particularly
speaking
such
case
as
you
supposed
about
mr
bingley
we
may
as
well
wait
perhaps
till
circumstance
occurs
before
we
discuss
discretion
his
behaviour
thereupon
but
in
general
ordinary
cases
between
friend
friend
where
one
them
desired
by
other
to
change
resolution
no
very
great
moment
you
think
ill
that
person
for
complying
with
desire
without
waiting
to
be
argued
into
will
not
be
advisable
before
we
proceed
on
subject
to
arrange
with
rather
more
precision
degree
importance
which
to
appertain
to
request
as
well
as
degree
intimacy
subsisting
between
parties
by
means
cried
bingley
let
us
hear
particulars
not
forgetting
their
comparative
height
size
for
that
will
more
weight
in
argument
miss
bennet
than
you
may
be
aware
assure
you
that
if
darcy
were
not
such
great
tall
fellow
in
comparison
with
myself
not
pay
him
half
so
much
deference
declare
do
not
know
more
awful
object
than
darcy
on
particular
occasions
in
particular
places
at
his
own
house
especially
sunday
evening
when
he
has
nothing
to
do
mr
darcy
smiled
but
elizabeth
thought
she
could
perceive
that
he
was
rather
offended
therefore
checked
her
laugh
miss
bingley
warmly
resented
indignity
he
had
received
in
an
expostulation
with
her
brother
for
talking
such
nonsense
see
your
design
bingley
said
his
friend
you
dislike
an
argument
want
to
silence
perhaps
do
arguments
too
much
like
disputes
if
you
miss
bennet
will
defer
yours
till
out
room
shall
be
very
thankful
then
you
may
say
whatever
you
like
me
what
you
ask
said
elizabeth
no
sacrifice
on
my
side
mr
darcy
had
much
better
finish
his
letter
mr
darcy
took
her
advice
did
finish
his
letter
when
that
business
was
over
he
applied
to
miss
bingley
elizabeth
for
an
indulgence
some
music
miss
bingley
moved
with
some
alacrity
to
pianoforte
after
polite
request
that
elizabeth
would
lead
way
which
other
as
politely
more
earnestly
negatived
she
seated
herself
mrs
hurst
sang
with
her
sister
while
they
were
thus
employed
elizabeth
could
not
help
observing
as
she
turned
over
some
music
books
that
lay
on
instrument
how
frequently
mr
darcy
s
eyes
were
fixed
on
her
she
hardly
knew
how
to
suppose
that
she
could
be
an
object
admiration
to
so
great
man
yet
that
he
look
at
her
because
he
disliked
her
was
still
more
strange
she
could
only
imagine
however
at
last
that
she
drew
his
notice
because
there
was
something
more
wrong
reprehensible
according
to
his
ideas
right
than
in
any
other
person
present
supposition
did
not
pain
her
she
liked
him
too
little
to
care
for
his
approbation
after
playing
some
italian
songs
miss
bingley
varied
charm
by
lively
scotch
air
soon
afterwards
mr
darcy
drawing
near
elizabeth
said
to
her
do
not
you
feel
great
inclination
miss
bennet
to
seize
such
an
opportunity
dancing
reel
she
smiled
but
made
no
answer
he
repeated
question
with
some
surprise
at
her
silence
oh
said
she
heard
you
before
but
could
not
immediately
determine
what
to
say
in
reply
you
wanted
me
know
to
say
yes
that
you
might
pleasure
despising
my
taste
but
always
delight
in
overthrowing
those
kind
schemes
cheating
person
their
premeditated
contempt
therefore
made
up
my
mind
to
tell
you
that
do
not
want
to
dance
reel
at
now
despise
me
if
you
dare
indeed
do
not
dare
elizabeth
having
rather
expected
to
affront
him
was
amazed
at
his
gallantry
but
there
was
mixture
sweetness
archness
in
her
manner
which
made
difficult
for
her
to
affront
anybody
darcy
had
never
been
so
bewitched
by
any
woman
as
he
was
by
her
he
really
believed
that
were
not
for
inferiority
her
connections
he
be
in
some
danger
miss
bingley
saw
or
suspected
enough
to
be
jealous
her
great
anxiety
for
recovery
her
dear
friend
jane
received
some
assistance
from
her
desire
getting
rid
elizabeth
she
often
tried
to
provoke
darcy
into
disliking
her
guest
by
talking
their
supposed
marriage
planning
his
happiness
in
such
an
alliance
hope
said
she
as
they
were
walking
together
in
shrubbery
next
day
you
will
give
your
mother
in
law
few
hints
when
desirable
event
takes
place
as
to
advantage
holding
her
tongue
if
you
can
compass
do
cure
younger
girls
running
after
officers
if
may
mention
so
delicate
subject
endeavour
to
check
that
little
something
bordering
on
conceit
impertinence
which
your
lady
possesses
you
anything
else
to
propose
for
my
domestic
felicity
oh
yes
do
let
portraits
your
uncle
aunt
phillips
be
placed
in
gallery
at
pemberley
put
them
next
to
your
great
uncle
judge
they
in
same
profession
you
know
only
in
different
lines
as
for
your
elizabeth
s
picture
you
must
not
taken
for
what
painter
could
do
justice
to
those
beautiful
eyes
would
not
be
easy
indeed
to
catch
their
expression
but
their
colour
shape
eyelashes
so
remarkably
fine
might
be
copied
at
that
moment
they
were
met
from
another
walk
by
mrs
hurst
elizabeth
herself
did
not
know
that
you
intended
to
walk
said
miss
bingley
in
some
confusion
lest
they
had
been
overheard
you
used
us
abominably
ill
answered
mrs
hurst
running
away
without
telling
us
that
you
were
coming
out
then
taking
disengaged
arm
mr
darcy
she
left
elizabeth
to
walk
by
herself
path
just
admitted
mr
darcy
felt
their
rudeness
immediately
said
walk
not
wide
enough
for
our
party
we
had
better
go
into
avenue
but
elizabeth
who
had
not
least
inclination
to
remain
with
them
laughingly
answered
no
no
stay
where
you
you
charmingly
grouped
appear
to
uncommon
advantage
picturesque
would
be
spoilt
by
admitting
fourth
good
bye
she
then
ran
gaily
off
rejoicing
as
she
rambled
about
in
hope
being
at
home
again
in
day
or
two
jane
was
already
so
much
recovered
as
to
intend
leaving
her
room
for
couple
hours
that
evening
chapter
when
ladies
removed
after
dinner
elizabeth
ran
up
to
her
sister
seeing
her
well
guarded
from
cold
attended
her
into
drawing
room
where
she
was
welcomed
by
her
two
friends
with
many
professions
pleasure
elizabeth
had
never
seen
them
so
agreeable
as
they
were
during
hour
which
passed
before
gentlemen
appeared
their
powers
conversation
were
considerable
they
could
describe
an
entertainment
with
accuracy
relate
an
anecdote
with
humour
laugh
at
their
acquaintance
with
spirit
but
when
gentlemen
entered
jane
was
no
longer
first
object
miss
bingley
s
eyes
were
instantly
turned
toward
darcy
she
had
something
to
say
to
him
before
he
had
advanced
many
steps
he
addressed
himself
to
miss
bennet
with
polite
congratulation
mr
hurst
also
made
her
slight
bow
said
he
was
very
glad
but
diffuseness
warmth
remained
for
bingley
s
salutation
he
was
full
joy
attention
first
half
hour
was
spent
in
piling
up
fire
lest
she
suffer
from
change
room
she
removed
at
his
desire
to
other
side
fireplace
that
she
might
be
further
from
door
he
then
sat
down
by
her
talked
scarcely
to
anyone
else
elizabeth
at
work
in
opposite
corner
saw
with
great
delight
when
tea
was
over
mr
hurst
reminded
his
sister
in
law
card
table
but
in
vain
she
had
obtained
private
intelligence
that
mr
darcy
did
not
wish
for
cards
mr
hurst
soon
found
even
his
open
petition
rejected
she
assured
him
that
no
one
intended
to
play
silence
whole
party
on
subject
seemed
to
justify
her
mr
hurst
had
therefore
nothing
to
do
but
to
stretch
himself
on
one
sofas
go
to
sleep
darcy
took
up
book
miss
bingley
did
same
mrs
hurst
principally
occupied
in
playing
with
her
bracelets
rings
joined
now
then
in
her
brother
s
conversation
with
miss
bennet
miss
bingley
s
attention
was
quite
as
much
engaged
in
watching
mr
darcy
s
progress
through
his
book
as
in
reading
her
own
she
was
perpetually
either
making
some
inquiry
or
looking
at
his

she
could
not
win
him
however
to
any
conversation
he
merely
answered
her
question
read
on
at
length
quite
exhausted
by
attempt
to
be
amused
with
her
own
book
which
she
had
only
chosen
because
was
volume
his
she
gave
great
yawn
said
how
pleasant
to
spend
an
evening
in
way
declare
after
there
no
enjoyment
like
reading
how
much
sooner
one
tires
anything
than
book
when
house
my
own
shall
be
miserable
if
not
an
excellent
library
no
one
made
any
reply
she
then
yawned
again
threw
aside
her
book
cast
her
eyes
round
room
in
quest
for
some
amusement
when
hearing
her
brother
mentioning
ball
to
miss
bennet
she
turned
suddenly
towards
him
said
by
bye
charles
you
really
serious
in
meditating
dance
at
netherfield
would
advise
you
before
you
determine
on
to
consult
wishes
present
party
much
mistaken
if
there
not
some
among
us
to
whom
ball
would
be
rather
punishment
than
pleasure
if
you
mean
darcy
cried
her
brother
he
may
go
to
bed
if
he
chooses
before
begins
but
as
for
ball
quite
settled
thing
as
soon
as
nicholls
has
made
white
soup
enough
shall
send
round
my
cards
like
balls
infinitely
better
she
replied
if
they
were
carried
on
in
different
manner
but
there
something
insufferably
tedious
in
usual
process
such
meeting
would
surely
be
much
more
rational
if
conversation
instead
dancing
were
made
order
day
much
more
rational
my
dear
caroline
dare
say
but
would
not
be
near
so
much
like
ball
miss
bingley
made
no
answer
soon
afterwards
she
got
up
walked
about
room
her
figure
was
elegant
she
walked
well
but
darcy
at
whom
was
aimed
was
still
inflexibly
studious
in
desperation
her
feelings
she
resolved
on
one
effort
more
turning
to
elizabeth
said
miss
eliza
bennet
let
me
persuade
you
to
follow
my
example
take
turn
about
room
assure
you
very
refreshing
after
sitting
so
long
in
one
attitude
elizabeth
was
surprised
but
agreed
to
immediately
miss
bingley
succeeded
no
less
in
real
object
her
civility
mr
darcy
looked
up
he
was
as
much
awake
to
novelty
attention
in
that
quarter
as
elizabeth
herself
could
be
unconsciously
closed
his
book
he
was
directly
invited
to
join
their
party
but
he
declined
observing
that
he
could
imagine
but
two
motives
for
their
choosing
to
walk
up
down
room
together
with
either
which
motives
his
joining
them
would
interfere
what
could
he
mean
she
was
dying
to
know
what
could
be
his
meaning
asked
elizabeth
whether
she
could
at
understand
him
not
at
was
her
answer
but
depend
upon
he
means
to
be
severe
on
us
our
surest
way
disappointing
him
will
be
to
ask
nothing
about
miss
bingley
however
was
incapable
disappointing
mr
darcy
in
anything
persevered
therefore
in
requiring
an
explanation
his
two
motives
not
smallest
objection
to
explaining
them
said
he
as
soon
as
she
allowed
him
to
speak
you
either
choose
method
passing
evening
because
you
in
each
other
s
confidence
secret
affairs
to
discuss
or
because
you
conscious
that
your
figures
appear
to
greatest
advantage
in
walking
if
first
would
be
completely
in
your
way
if
can
admire
you
much
better
as
sit
by
fire
oh
shocking
cried
miss
bingley
never
heard
anything
so
abominable
how
shall
we
punish
him
for
such
speech
nothing
so
easy
if
you
but
inclination
said
elizabeth
we
can
plague
punish
one
another
tease
him
laugh
at
him
intimate
as
you
you
must
know
how
to
be
done
but
upon
my
honour
do
not
do
assure
you
that
my
intimacy
has
not
yet
taught
me
that
tease
calmness
manner
presence
mind
no
no
feel
he
may
defy
us
there
as
to
laughter
we
will
not
expose
ourselves
if
you
please
by
attempting
to
laugh
without
subject
mr
darcy
may
hug
himself
mr
darcy
not
to
be
laughed
at
cried
elizabeth
that
an
uncommon
advantage
uncommon
hope
will
continue
for
would
be
great
loss
to
me
to
many
such
acquaintances
dearly
love
laugh
miss
bingley
said
he
has
given
me
more
credit
than
can
be
wisest
best
men
nay
wisest
best
their
actions
may
be
rendered
ridiculous
by
person
whose
first
object
in
life
joke
certainly
replied
elizabeth
there
such
people
but
hope
not
one
them
hope
never
ridicule
what
wise
good
follies
nonsense
whims
inconsistencies
do
divert
me
own
laugh
at
them
whenever
can
but
these
suppose
precisely
what
you
without
perhaps
that
not
possible
for
anyone
but
has
been
study
my
life
to
avoid
those
weaknesses
which
often
expose
strong
understanding
to
ridicule
such
as
vanity
pride
yes
vanity
weakness
indeed
but
pride
where
there
real
superiority
mind
pride
will
be
always
under
good
regulation
elizabeth
turned
away
to
hide
smile
your
examination
mr
darcy
over
presume
said
miss
bingley
pray
what
result
perfectly
convinced
by
that
mr
darcy
has
no
defect
he
owns
himself
without
disguise
no
said
darcy
made
no
such
pretension
faults
enough
but
they
not
hope
understanding
my
temper
dare
not
vouch
for
believe
too
little
yielding
certainly
too
little
for
convenience
world
cannot
forget
follies
vices
other
so
soon
as
ought
nor
their
offenses
against
myself
my
feelings
not
puffed
about
with
every
attempt
to
move
them
my
temper
would
perhaps
be
called
resentful
my
good
opinion
once
lost
lost
forever
that
failing
indeed
cried
elizabeth
implacable
resentment
shade
in
character
but
you
chosen
your
fault
well
really
cannot
laugh
at
you
safe
from
me
there
believe
in
every
disposition
tendency
to
some
particular
evil
natural
defect
which
not
even
best
education
can
overcome
your
defect
to
hate
everybody
yours
he
replied
with
smile
willfully
to
misunderstand
them
do
let
us
little
music
cried
miss
bingley
tired
conversation
in
which
she
had
no
share
louisa
you
will
not
mind
my
waking
mr
hurst
her
sister
had
not
smallest
objection
pianoforte
was
opened
darcy
after
few
moments
recollection
was
not
sorry
for
he
began
to
feel
danger
paying
elizabeth
too
much
attention
chapter
in
consequence
an
agreement
between
sisters
elizabeth
wrote
next
morning
to
their
mother
to
beg
that
carriage
might
be
sent
for
them
in
course
day
but
mrs
bennet
who
had
calculated
on
her
daughters
remaining
at
netherfield
till
following
tuesday
which
would
exactly
finish
jane
s
week
could
not
bring
herself
to
receive
them
with
pleasure
before
her
answer
therefore
was
not
propitious
at
least
not
to
elizabeth
s
wishes
for
she
was
impatient
to
get
home
mrs
bennet
sent
them
word
that
they
could
not
possibly
carriage
before
tuesday
in
her
postscript
was
added
that
if
mr
bingley
his
sister
pressed
them
to
stay
longer
she
could
spare
them
very
well
against
staying
longer
however
elizabeth
was
positively
resolved
nor
did
she
much
expect
would
be
asked
fearful
on
contrary
as
being
considered
as
intruding
themselves
needlessly
long
she
urged
jane
to
borrow
mr
bingley
s
carriage
immediately
at
length
was
settled
that
their
original
design
leaving
netherfield
that
morning
be
mentioned
request
made
communication
excited
many
professions
concern
enough
was
said
wishing
them
to
stay
at
least
till
following
day
to
work
on
jane
till
morrow
their
going
was
deferred
miss
bingley
was
then
sorry
that
she
had
proposed
delay
for
her
jealousy
dislike
one
sister
much
exceeded
her
affection
for
other
master
house
heard
with
real
sorrow
that
they
were
to
go
so
soon
repeatedly
tried
to
persuade
miss
bennet
that
would
not
be
safe
for
her
that
she
was
not
enough
recovered
but
jane
was
firm
where
she
felt
herself
to
be
right
to
mr
darcy
was
welcome
intelligence
elizabeth
had
been
at
netherfield
long
enough
she
attracted
him
more
than
he
liked
miss
bingley
was
uncivil
to
her
more
teasing
than
usual
to
himself
he
wisely
resolved
to
be
particularly
careful
that
no
sign
admiration
now
escape
him
nothing
that
could
elevate
her
with
hope
influencing
his
felicity
sensible
that
if
such
an
idea
had
been
suggested
his
behaviour
during
last
day
must
material
weight
in
confirming
or
crushing
steady
to
his
purpose
he
scarcely
spoke
ten
words
to
her
through
whole
saturday
though
they
were
at
one
time
left
by
themselves
for
half
an
hour
he
adhered
most
conscientiously
to
his
book
would
not
even
look
at
her
on
sunday
after
morning
service
separation
so
agreeable
to
almost
took
place
miss
bingley
s
civility
to
elizabeth
increased
at
last
very
rapidly
as
well
as
her
affection
for
jane
when
they
parted
after
assuring
latter
pleasure
would
always
give
her
to
see
her
either
at
longbourn
or
netherfield
embracing
her
most
tenderly
she
even
shook
hands
with
former
elizabeth
took
leave
whole
party
in
liveliest
spirits
they
were
not
welcomed
home
very
cordially
by
their
mother
mrs
bennet
wondered
at
their
coming
thought
them
very
wrong
to
give
so
much
trouble
was
sure
jane
would
caught
cold
again
but
their
father
though
very
laconic
in
his
expressions
pleasure
was
really
glad
to
see
them
he
had
felt
their
importance
in
family
circle
evening
conversation
when
they
were
assembled
had
lost
much
its
animation
almost
its
sense
by
absence
jane
elizabeth
they
found
mary
as
usual
deep
in
study
thorough
bass
human
nature
had
some
extracts
to
admire
some
new
observations
threadbare
morality
to
listen
to
catherine
lydia
had
information
for
them
different
sort
much
had
been
done
much
had
been
said
in

since
preceding
wednesday
several
officers
had
dined
lately
with
their
uncle
private
had
been
flogged
had
actually
been
hinted
that
colonel
forster

chapter
hope
my
dear
said
mr
bennet
to
his
wife
as
they
were
at
breakfast
next
morning
that
you
ordered
good
dinner
to
day
because
reason
to
expect
an
addition
to
our
family
party
who
do
you
mean
my
dear
know
nobody
that
coming
sure
unless
charlotte
lucas
happen
to
call
in

my
dinners
good

for
her
do
not

she
often
sees
such

eyes
sparkled
gentleman
stranger
mr
bingley
sure
well
sure
shall
be
extremely
glad
to
see
mr
bingley
but
good
lord
how
unlucky
there
not
bit
fish
to
be
got
to

lydia
my
love
ring

must
speak
to
hill
moment
not
mr
bingley
said
her
husband
person
whom
never
saw
in
whole
course
my
life
roused
general
astonishment
he
had
pleasure
being
eagerly
questioned
by
his
wife
his
five
daughters
at
once
after
amusing
himself
some
time
with
their
curiosity
he
thus
explained
about
month
ago
received
letter
about
fortnight
ago
answered
for
thought
case
some
delicacy
requiring
early
attention
from
my
cousin
mr
collins
who
when
dead
may
turn
you
out
house
as
soon
as
he
pleases
oh
my
dear
cried
his
wife
cannot
bear
to
hear
that
mentioned
pray
do
not
talk
that
odious
man
do
think
hardest
thing
in
world
that
your
estate
be
entailed
away
from
your
own
children
sure
if
had
been
you
tried
long
ago
to
do
something
or
other
about
jane
elizabeth
tried
to
explain
to
her
nature
an
entail
they
had
often
attempted
to
do
before
but
was
subject
on
which
mrs
bennet
was
beyond
reach
reason
she
continued
to
rail
bitterly
against
cruelty
settling
an
estate
away
from
family
five
daughters
in
favour
man
whom
nobody
cared
anything
about
certainly
most
iniquitous
affair
said
mr
bennet
nothing
can
clear
mr
collins
from
guilt
inheriting
longbourn
but
if
you
will
listen
to
his
letter
you
may
perhaps
be
little
softened
by
his
manner
expressing
himself
no
that
sure
shall
not
think
very
impertinent
him
to
write
to
you
at
very
hypocritical
hate
such
false
friends
why
could
he
not
keep
on
quarreling
with
you
as
his
father
did
before
him
why
indeed
he
does
seem
to
had
some
filial
scruples
on
that
head
as
you
will
hear
hunsford
near
westerham
kent
th
october
dear
sir
disagreement
subsisting
between
yourself
my
late
honoured
father
always
gave
me
much
uneasiness
since
had
misfortune
to
lose
him
frequently
wished
to
heal
breach
but
for
some
time
was
kept
back
by
my
own
doubts
fearing
lest
might
seem
disrespectful
to
his
memory
for
me
to
be
on
good
terms
with
anyone
with
whom
had
always
pleased
him
to
be
at
variance
there
mrs
bennet
my
mind
however
now
made
up
on
subject
for
having
received
ordination
at
easter
been
so
fortunate
as
to
be
distinguished
by
patronage
right
honourable
lady
catherine
de
bourgh
widow
sir
lewis
de
bourgh
whose
bounty
beneficence
has
preferred
me
to
valuable
rectory
parish
where
shall
be
my
earnest
endeavour
to
demean
myself
with
grateful
respect
towards
her
ladyship
be
ever
ready
to
perform
those
rites
ceremonies
which
instituted
by
church
england
as
clergyman
moreover
feel
my
duty
to
promote
establish
blessing
peace
in
families
within
reach
my
influence
on
these
grounds
flatter
myself
that
my
present
overtures
highly
commendable
that
circumstance
my
being
next
in
entail
longbourn
estate
will
be
kindly
overlooked
on
your
side
not
lead
you
to
reject
offered
olive
branch
cannot
be
otherwise
than
concerned
at
being
means
injuring
your
amiable
daughters
beg
leave
to
apologise
for
as
well
as
to
assure
you
my
readiness
to
make
them
every
possible
amends
but
hereafter
if
you
no
objection
to
receive
me
into
your
house
propose
myself
satisfaction
waiting
on
you
your
family
monday
november
th
by
four
o

shall
probably
trespass
on
your
hospitality
till
saturday
se
ennight
following
which
can
do
without
any
inconvenience
as
lady
catherine
far
from
objecting
to
my
occasional
absence
on
sunday
provided
that
some
other
clergyman
engaged
to
do
duty
day
remain
dear
sir
with
respectful
compliments
to
your
lady
daughters
your
well
wisher
friend
william
collins
at
four
o
clock
therefore
we
may
expect
peace
making
gentleman
said
mr
bennet
as
he
folded
up
letter
he
seems
to
be
most
conscientious
polite
young
man
upon
my
word
doubt
not
will
prove
valuable
acquaintance
especially
if
lady
catherine
be
so
indulgent
as
to
let
him
come
to
us
again
there
some
sense
in
what
he
says
about
girls
however
if
he
disposed
to
make
them
any
amends
shall
not
be
person
to
discourage
him
though
difficult
said
jane
to
guess
in
what
way
he
can
mean
to
make
us
atonement
he
thinks
our
due
wish
certainly
to
his
credit
elizabeth
was
chiefly
struck
by
his
extraordinary
deference
for
lady
catherine
his
kind
intention
christening
marrying
burying
his
parishioners
whenever
were
required
he
must
be
an
oddity
think
said
she
cannot
make
him
out
there
something
very
pompous
in
his
style
what
can
he
mean
by
apologising
for
being
next
in
entail
we
cannot
suppose
he
would
help
if
he
could
could
he
be
sensible
man
sir
no
my
dear
think
not
great
hopes
finding
him
quite
reverse
there
mixture
servility
self
importance
in
his
letter
which
promises
well
impatient
to
see
him
in
point
composition
said
mary
letter
does
not
seem
defective
idea
olive
branch
perhaps
not
wholly
new
yet
think
well
expressed
to
catherine
lydia
neither
letter
nor
its
writer
were
in
any
degree
interesting
was
next
to
impossible
that
their
cousin
come
in
scarlet
coat
was
now
some
weeks
since
they
had
received
pleasure
from
society
man
in
any
other
colour
as
for
their
mother
mr
collins
s
letter
had
done
away
much
her
ill
will
she
was
preparing
to
see
him
with
degree
composure
which
astonished
her
husband
daughters
mr
collins
was
punctual
to
his
time
was
received
with
great
politeness
by
whole
family
mr
bennet
indeed
said
little
but
ladies
were
ready
enough
to
talk
mr
collins
seemed
neither
in
need
encouragement
nor
inclined
to
be
silent
himself
he
was
tall
heavy
looking
young
man
five
twenty
his
air
was
grave
stately
his
manners
were
very
formal
he
had
not
been
long
seated
before
he
complimented
mrs
bennet
on
having
so
fine
family
daughters
said
he
had
heard
much
their
beauty
but
that
in
instance
fame
had
fallen
short
truth
added
that
he
did
not
doubt
her
seeing
them
in
due
time
disposed
in
marriage
gallantry
was
not
much
to
taste
some
his
hearers
but
mrs
bennet
who
quarreled
with
no
compliments
answered
most
readily
you
very
kind
sure
wish
with
my
heart
may
prove
so
for
else
they
will

enough
things
settled
so
oddly
you
allude
perhaps
to
entail
estate
ah
sir
do
indeed
grievous
affair
to
my
poor
girls
you
must
confess
not
that
mean
to
find
fault
with
you
for
such
things
know
chance
in
world
there
no
knowing
how
estates
will
go
when
once
they
come
to
be
entailed
very
sensible
madam
hardship
to
my
fair
cousins
could
say
much
on
subject
but
that
cautious
appearing
forward
precipitate
but
can
assure
young
ladies
that
come
prepared
to
admire
them
at
present
will
not
say
more
but
perhaps
when
we
better
acquainted
he
was
interrupted
by
summons
to
dinner
girls
smiled
on
each
other
they
were
not
only
objects
mr
collins
s
admiration
hall
dining
room
its
furniture
were
examined
praised
his
commendation
everything
would
touched
mrs
bennet
s
heart
but
for
mortifying
supposition
his
viewing
as
his
own
future
property
dinner
too
in
its
turn
was
highly
admired
he
begged
to
know
to
which
his
fair
cousins
excellency
its
cooking
was
owing
but
he
was
set
right
there
by
mrs
bennet
who
assured
him
with
some
asperity
that
they
were
very
well
able
to
keep
good
cook
that
her
daughters
had
nothing
to
do
in
kitchen
he
begged
pardon
for
having
displeased
her
in
softened
tone
she
declared
herself
not
at
offended
but
he
continued
to
apologise
for
about
quarter
an
hour
chapter
during
dinner
mr
bennet
scarcely
spoke
at
but
when
servants
were
withdrawn
he
thought
time
to
some
conversation
with
his
guest
therefore
started
subject
in
which
he
expected
him
to
shine
by
observing
that
he
seemed
very
fortunate
in
his
patroness
lady
catherine
de
bourgh
s
attention
to
his
wishes
consideration
for
his
comfort
appeared
very
remarkable
mr
bennet
could
not
chosen
better
mr
collins
was
eloquent
in
her
praise
subject
elevated
him
to
more
than
usual
solemnity
manner
with
most
important
aspect
he
protested
that
he
had
never
in
his
life
witnessed
such
behaviour
in
person
rank
such
affability
condescension
as
he
had
himself
experienced
from
lady
catherine
she
had
been
graciously
pleased
to
approve
both
discourses
which
he
had
already
had
honour
preaching
before
her
she
had
also
asked
him
twice
to
dine
at
rosings
had
sent
for
him
only
saturday
before
to
make
up
her
pool
quadrille
in
evening
lady
catherine
was
reckoned
proud
by
many
people
he
knew
but
he
had
never
seen
anything
but
affability
in
her
she
had
always
spoken
to
him
as
she
would
to
any
other
gentleman
she
made
not
smallest
objection
to
his
joining
in
society
neighbourhood
nor
to
his
leaving
parish
occasionally
for
week
or
two
to
visit
his
relations
she
had
even
condescended
to
advise
him
to
marry
as
soon
as
he
could
provided
he
chose
with
discretion
had
once
paid
him
visit
in
his
humble
parsonage
where
she
had
perfectly
approved
alterations
he
had
been
making
had
even
vouchsafed
to
suggest
some
herself
some
shelves
in
closet
upstairs
that
very
proper
civil
sure
said
mrs
bennet
dare
say
she
very
agreeable
woman
pity
that
great
ladies
in
general
not
more
like
her
does
she
live
near
you
sir
garden
in
which
stands
my
humble
abode
separated
only
by
lane
from
rosings
park
her
ladyship
s
residence
think
you
said
she
was
widow
sir
has
she
any
family
she
has
only
one
daughter
heiress
rosings
very
extensive
property
ah
said
mrs
bennet
shaking
her
head
then
she
better
off
than
many
girls
what
sort
young
lady
she
she
handsome
she
most
charming
young
lady
indeed
lady
catherine
herself
says
that
in
point
true
beauty
miss
de
bourgh
far
superior
to
handsomest
her
sex
because
there
that
in
her
features
which
marks
young
lady
distinguished
birth
she
unfortunately
sickly
constitution
which
has
prevented
her
from
making
that
progress
in
many
accomplishments
which
she
could
not
otherwise
failed
as
informed
by
lady
who
superintended
her
education
who
still
resides
with
them
but
she
perfectly
amiable
often
condescends
to
drive
by
my
humble
abode
in
her
little
phaeton
ponies
has
she
been
presented
do
not
remember
her
name
among
ladies
at
court
her
indifferent
state
health
unhappily
prevents
her
being
in
town
by
that
means
as
told
lady
catherine
one
day
has
deprived
british
court
its
brightest
ornaments
her
ladyship
seemed
pleased
with
idea
you
may
imagine
that
happy
on
every
occasion
to
offer
those
little
delicate
compliments
which
always
acceptable
to
ladies
more
than
once
observed
to
lady
catherine
that
her
charming
daughter
seemed
born
to
be
duchess
that
most
elevated
rank
instead
giving
her
consequence
would
be
adorned
by
her
these
kind
little
things
which
please
her
ladyship
sort
attention
which
conceive
myself
peculiarly
bound
to
pay
you
judge
very
properly
said
mr
bennet
happy
for
you
that
you
possess
talent
flattering
with
delicacy
may
ask
whether
these
pleasing
attentions
proceed
from
impulse
moment
or
result
previous
study
they
arise
chiefly
from
what
passing
at
time
though
sometimes
amuse
myself
with
suggesting
arranging
such
little
elegant
compliments
as
may
be
adapted
to
ordinary
occasions
always
wish
to
give
them
as
unstudied
an
air
as
possible
mr
bennet
s
expectations
were
fully
answered
his
cousin
was
as
absurd
as
he
had
hoped
he
listened
to
him
with
keenest
enjoyment
maintaining
at
same
time
most
resolute
composure
countenance
except
in
an
occasional
glance
at
elizabeth
requiring
no
partner
in
his
pleasure
by
tea
time
however
dose
had
been
enough
mr
bennet
was
glad
to
take
his
guest
into
drawing
room
again
when
tea
was
over
glad
to
invite
him
to
read
aloud
to
ladies
mr
collins
readily
assented
book
was
produced
but
on
beholding
for
everything
announced
to
be
from
circulating
library
he
started
back
begging
pardon
protested
that
he
never
read
novels
kitty
stared
at
him
lydia
exclaimed
other
books
were
produced
after
some
deliberation
he
chose
fordyce
s
sermons
lydia
gaped
as
he
opened
volume
before
he
had
with
very
monotonous
solemnity
read
pages
she
interrupted
him
with
do
you
know
mamma
that
my
uncle
phillips
talks
turning
away
richard
if
he
does
colonel
forster
will
hire
him
my
aunt
told
me
so
herself
on
saturday
shall
walk
to
meryton
to
morrow
to
hear
more
about
to
ask
when
mr
denny
comes
back
from
town
lydia
was
bid
by
her
two
eldest
sisters
to
hold
her
tongue
but
mr
collins
much
offended
laid
aside
his
book
said
often
observed
how
little
young
ladies
interested
by
books
serious
stamp
though
written
solely
for
their
benefit
amazes
me
confess
for
certainly
there
can
be
nothing
so
advantageous
to
them
as
instruction
but
will
no
longer
importune
my
young
cousin
then
turning
to
mr
bennet
he
offered
himself
as
his
antagonist
at
backgammon
mr
bennet
accepted
challenge
observing
that
he
acted
very
wisely
in
leaving
girls
to
their
own
trifling
amusements
mrs
bennet
her
daughters
apologised
most
civilly
for
lydia
s
interruption
promised
that
not
occur
again
if
he
would
resume
his
book
but
mr
collins
after
assuring
them
that
he
bore
his
young
cousin
no
ill
will
never
resent
her
behaviour
as
any
affront
seated
himself
at
another
table
with
mr
bennet
prepared
for
backgammon
chapter
mr
collins
was
not
sensible
man
deficiency
nature
had
been
but
little
assisted
by
education
or
society
greatest
part
his
life
having
been
spent
under
guidance
an
illiterate
miserly
father
though
he
belonged
to
one
universities
he
had
merely
kept
necessary
terms
without
forming
at
any
useful
acquaintance
subjection
in
which
his
father
had
brought
him
up
had
given
him
originally
great
humility
manner
but
was
now
good
deal
counteracted
by
self
conceit
weak
head
living
in
retirement
consequential
feelings
early
unexpected
prosperity
fortunate
chance
had
recommended
him
to
lady
catherine
de
bourgh
when
living
hunsford
was
vacant
respect
which
he
felt
for
her
high
rank
his
veneration
for
her
as
his
patroness
mingling
with
very
good
opinion
himself
his
authority
as
clergyman
his
right
as
rector
made
him
altogether
mixture
pride
obsequiousness
self
importance
humility
having
now
good
house
very
sufficient
income
he
intended
to
marry
in
seeking
reconciliation
with
longbourn
family
he
had
wife
in
view
as
he
meant
to
choose
one
daughters
if
he
found
them
as
handsome
amiable
as
they
were
represented
by
common
report
was
his
plan
amends
atonement
for
inheriting
their
father
s
estate
he
thought
an
excellent
one
full
eligibility
suitableness
excessively
generous
disinterested
on
his
own
part
his
plan
did
not
vary
on
seeing
them
miss
bennet
s
lovely
face
confirmed
his
views
established
his
strictest
notions
what
was
due
to
seniority
for
first

she
was
his
settled
choice
next
morning
however
made
an
alteration
for
in

an
hour

tete

with
mrs
bennet
before
breakfast
conversation
beginning
with
his
parsonage
house
leading
naturally
to
avowal
his
hopes
that
mistress
might
be
found
for
at
longbourn
produced
from
her
amid
very
complaisant
smiles
general
encouragement
caution
against
very
jane
he
had
fixed
on
as
to
her
younger
daughters
she
could
not
take
upon
her
to
say
she
could
not
positively
answer
but
she
did
not
know
any
prepossession
her
eldest
daughter
she
must
just
mention
she
felt
incumbent
on
her
to
hint
was
likely
to
be
very
soon
engaged
mr
collins
had
only
to
change
from
jane
to
elizabeth
was
soon
done
done
while
mrs
bennet
was
stirring
fire
elizabeth
equally
next
to
jane
in
birth
beauty
succeeded
her
course
mrs
bennet
treasured
up
hint
trusted
that
she
might
soon
two
daughters
married
man
whom
she
could
not
bear
to
speak
day
before
was
now
high
in
her
good
graces
lydia
s
intention
walking
to
meryton
was
not
forgotten
every
sister
except
mary
agreed
to
go
with
her
mr
collins
was
to
attend
them
at
request
mr
bennet
who
was
most
anxious
to
get
rid
him
his
library
to
himself
for
thither
mr
collins
had
followed
him
after
breakfast
there
he
would
continue
nominally
engaged
with
one
largest
folios
in
collection
but
really
talking
to
mr
bennet
with
little
cessation
his
house
garden
at
hunsford
such
doings
discomposed
mr
bennet
exceedingly
in
his
library
he
had
been
always
sure
leisure
tranquillity
though
prepared
as
he
told
elizabeth
to
meet
with
folly
conceit
in
every
other
room
house
he
was
used
to
be
from
them
there
his
civility
therefore
was
most
prompt
in
inviting
mr
collins
to
join
his
daughters
in
their
walk
mr
collins
being
in
fact
much
better
fitted
for
walker
than
reader
was
extremely
pleased
to
close
his
large
book
go
in
pompous
nothings
on
his
side
civil
assents
on
that
his
cousins
their
time
passed
till
they
entered
meryton
attention
younger
ones
was
then
no
longer
to
be
gained
by
him
their
eyes
were
immediately
wandering
up
in
street
in
quest
officers
nothing
less
than
very
smart
bonnet
indeed
or
really
new
muslin
in
shop
window
could
recall
them
but
attention
every
lady
was
soon
caught
by
young
man
whom
they
had
never
seen
before
most
gentlemanlike
appearance
walking
with
another
officer
on
other
side
way
officer
was
very
mr
denny
concerning
whose
return
from
london
lydia
came
to
inquire
he
bowed
as
they
passed
were
struck
with
stranger
s
air
wondered
who
he
could
be
kitty
lydia
determined
if
possible
to
find
out
led
way
across
street
under
pretense
wanting
something
in
an
opposite
shop
fortunately
had
just
gained
pavement
when
two
gentlemen
turning
back
had
reached
same
spot
mr
denny
addressed
them
directly
entreated
permission
to
introduce
his
friend
mr
wickham
who
had
returned
with
him
day
before
from
town
he
was
happy
to
say
had
accepted
commission
in
their
corps
was
exactly
as
be
for
young
man
wanted
only
regimentals
to
make
him
completely
charming
his
appearance
was
greatly
in
his
favour
he
had
best
part
beauty
fine
countenance
good
figure
very
pleasing
address
introduction
was
followed
up
on
his
side
by
happy
readiness
conversation
readiness
at
same
time
perfectly
correct
unassuming
whole
party
were
still
standing
talking
together
very
agreeably
when
sound
horses
drew
their
notice
darcy
bingley
were
seen
riding
down
street
on
distinguishing
ladies
group
two
gentlemen
came
directly
towards
them
began
usual
civilities
bingley
was
principal
spokesman
miss
bennet
principal
object
he
was
then
he
said
on
his
way
to
longbourn
on
purpose
to
inquire
after
her
mr
darcy
corroborated
with
bow
was
beginning
to
determine
not
to
fix
his
eyes
on
elizabeth
when
they
were
suddenly
arrested
by
sight
stranger
elizabeth
happening
to
see
countenance
both
as
they
looked
at
each
other
was
astonishment
at
effect
meeting
both
changed
colour
one
looked
white
other
red
mr
wickham
after
few
moments
touched
his
hat
salutation
which
mr
darcy
just
deigned
to
return
what
could
be
meaning
was
impossible
to
imagine
was
impossible
not
to
long
to
know
in
another
minute
mr
bingley
but
without
seeming
to
noticed
what
passed
took
leave
rode
on
with
his
friend
mr
denny
mr
wickham
walked
with
young
ladies
to
door
mr
phillip
s
house
then
made
their
bows
in
spite
miss
lydia
s
pressing
entreaties
that
they
come
in
even
in
spite
mrs
phillips
s
throwing
up
parlour
window
loudly
seconding
invitation
mrs
phillips
was
always
glad
to
see
her
nieces
two
eldest
from
their
recent
absence
were
particularly
welcome
she
was
eagerly
expressing
her
surprise
at
their
sudden
return
home
which
as
their
own
carriage
had
not
fetched
them
she
known
nothing
about
if
she
had
not
happened
to
see
mr
jones
s
shop
boy
in
street
who
had
told
her
that
they
were
not
to
send
any
more
draughts
to
netherfield
because
miss
bennets
were
come
away
when
her
civility
was
claimed
towards
mr
collins
by
jane
s
introduction
him
she
received
him
with
her
very
best
politeness
which
he
returned
with
as
much
more
apologising
for
his
intrusion
without
any
previous
acquaintance
with
her
which
he
could
not
help
flattering
himself
however
might
be
justified
by
his
relationship
to
young
ladies
who
introduced
him
to
her
notice
mrs
phillips
was
quite
awed
by
such
an
excess
good
breeding
but
her
contemplation
one
stranger
was
soon
put
to
an
end
by
exclamations
inquiries
about
other
whom
however
she
could
only
tell
her
nieces
what
they
already
knew
that
mr
denny
had
brought
him
from
london
that
he
was
to
lieutenant
s
commission
in
shire
she
had
been
watching
him
last
hour
she
said
as
he
walked
up
down
street
had
mr
wickham
appeared
kitty
lydia
would
certainly
continued
occupation
but
unluckily
no
one
passed
windows
now
except
few
officers
who
in
comparison
with
stranger
were
become
stupid
disagreeable
fellows
some
them
were
to
dine
with
phillipses
next
day
their
aunt
promised
to
make
her
husband
call
on
mr
wickham
give
him
an
invitation
also
if
family
from
longbourn
would
come
in
evening
was
agreed
to
mrs
phillips
protested
that
they
would
nice
comfortable
noisy
game
lottery
tickets
little
bit
hot
supper
afterwards
prospect
such
delights
was
very
cheering
they
parted
in
mutual
good
spirits
mr
collins
repeated
his
apologies
in
quitting
room
was
assured
with
unwearying
civility
that
they
were
perfectly
needless
as
they
walked
home
elizabeth
related
to
jane
what
she
had
seen
pass
between
two
gentlemen
but
though
jane
would
defended
either
or
both
had
they
appeared
to
be
in
wrong
she
could
no
more
explain
such
behaviour
than
her
sister
mr
collins
on
his
return
highly
gratified
mrs
bennet
by
admiring
mrs
phillips
s
manners
politeness
he
protested
that
except
lady
catherine
her
daughter
he
had
never
seen
more
elegant
woman
for
she
had
not
only
received
him
with
utmost
civility
but
even
pointedly
included
him
in
her
invitation
for
next
evening
although
utterly
unknown
to
her
before
something
he
supposed
might
be
attributed
to
his
connection
with
them
but
yet
he
had
never
met
with
so
much
attention
in
whole
course
his
life
chapter
as
no
objection
was
made
to
young
people
s
engagement
with
their
aunt
mr
collins
s
scruples
leaving
mr
mrs
bennet
for
single
evening
during
his
visit
were
most
steadily
resisted
coach
conveyed
him
his
five
cousins
at
suitable
hour
to
meryton
girls
had
pleasure
hearing
as
they
entered
drawing
room
that
mr
wickham
had
accepted
their
uncle
s
invitation
was
then
in
house
when
information
was
given
they
had
taken
their
seats
mr
collins
was
at
leisure
to
look
around
him
admire
he
was
so
much
struck
with
size
furniture
apartment
that
he
declared
he
might
almost
supposed
himself
in
small
summer
breakfast
parlour
at
rosings
comparison
that
did
not
at
first
convey
much
gratification
but
when
mrs
phillips
understood
from
him
what
rosings
was
who
was
its
proprietor
when
she
had
listened
to
description
only
one
lady
catherine
s
drawing
rooms
found
that
chimney
piece
alone
had
cost
eight
hundred
pounds
she
felt
force
compliment
would
hardly
resented
comparison
with
housekeeper
s
room
in
describing
to
her
grandeur
lady
catherine
her
mansion
with
occasional
digressions
in
praise
his
own
humble
abode
improvements
was
receiving
he
was
happily
employed
until
gentlemen
joined
them
he
found
in
mrs
phillips
very
attentive
listener
whose
opinion
his
consequence
increased
with
what
she
heard
who
was
resolving
to
retail
among
her
neighbours
as
soon
as
she
could
to
girls
who
could
not
listen
to
their
cousin
who
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
wish
for
an
instrument
examine
their
own
indifferent
imitations
china
on
mantelpiece
interval
waiting
appeared
very
long
was
over
at
last
however
gentlemen
did
approach
when
mr
wickham
walked
into
room
elizabeth
felt
that
she
had
neither
been
seeing
him
before
nor
thinking
him
since
with
smallest
degree
unreasonable
admiration
officers
shire
were
in
general
very
creditable
gentlemanlike
set
best
them
were
present
party
but
mr
wickham
was
as
far
beyond
them
in
person
countenance
air
walk
as
they
were
superior
to
broad
faced
stuffy
uncle
phillips
breathing
port
wine
who
followed
them
into
room
mr
wickham
was
happy
man
towards
whom
almost
every
female
eye
was
turned
elizabeth
was
happy
woman
by
whom
he
finally
seated
himself
agreeable
manner
in
which
he
immediately
fell
into
conversation
though
was
only
on
its
being
wet
night
made
her
feel
that
commonest
dullest
most
threadbare
topic
might
be
rendered
interesting
by
skill
speaker
with
such
rivals
for
notice
fair
as
mr
wickham
officers
mr
collins
seemed
to
sink
into
insignificance
to
young
ladies
he
certainly
was
nothing
but
he
had
still
at
intervals
kind
listener
in
mrs
phillips
was
by
her
watchfulness
most
abundantly
supplied
with
coffee
muffin
when
card
tables
were
placed
he
had
opportunity
obliging
her
in
turn
by
sitting
down
to
whist
know
little
game
at
present
said
he
but
shall
be
glad
to
improve
myself
for
in
my
situation
in
life
mrs
phillips
was
very
glad
for
his
compliance
but
could
not
wait
for
his
reason
mr
wickham
did
not
play
at
whist
with
ready
delight
was
he
received
at
other
table
between
elizabeth
lydia
at
first
there
seemed
danger
lydia
s
engrossing
him
entirely
for
she
was
most
determined
talker
but
being
likewise
extremely
fond
lottery
tickets
she
soon
grew
too
much
interested
in
game
too
eager
in
making
bets
exclaiming
after
prizes
to
attention
for
anyone
in
particular
allowing
for
common
demands
game
mr
wickham
was
therefore
at
leisure
to
talk
to
elizabeth
she
was
very
willing
to
hear
him
though
what
she
chiefly
wished
to
hear
she
could
not
hope
to
be
told
history
his
acquaintance
with
mr
darcy
she
dared
not
even
mention
that
gentleman
her
curiosity
however
was
unexpectedly
relieved
mr
wickham
began
subject
himself
he
inquired
how
far
netherfield
was
from
meryton
after
receiving
her
answer
asked
in
hesitating
manner
how
long
mr
darcy
had
been
staying
there
about
month
said
elizabeth
then
unwilling
to
let
subject
drop
added
he
man
very
large
property
in
derbyshire
understand
yes
replied
mr
wickham
his
estate
there
noble
one
clear
ten
thousand
per
annum
you
could
not
met
with
person
more
capable
giving
you
certain
information
on
that
head
than
myself
for
been
connected
with
his
family
in
particular
manner
from
my
infancy
elizabeth
could
not
but
look
surprised
you
may
well
be
surprised
miss
bennet
at
such
an
assertion
after
seeing
as
you
probably
might
very
cold
manner
our
meeting
yesterday
you
much
acquainted
with
mr
darcy
as
much
as
ever
wish
to
be
cried
elizabeth
very
warmly
spent
four
days
in
same
house
with
him
think
him
very
disagreeable
no
right
to
give
my
opinion
said
wickham
as
to
his
being
agreeable
or
otherwise
not
qualified
to
form
one
known
him
too
long
too
well
to
be
fair
judge
impossible
for
me
to
be
impartial
but
believe
your
opinion
him
would
in
general
astonish
perhaps
you
would
not
express
quite
so
strongly
anywhere
else
here
you
in
your
own
family
upon
my
word
say
no
more
here
than
might
say
in
any
house
in
neighbourhood
except
netherfield
he
not
at
liked
in
hertfordshire
everybody
disgusted
with
his
pride
you
will
not
find
him
more
favourably
spoken
by
anyone
cannot
pretend
to
be
sorry
said
wickham
after
short
interruption
that
he
or
that
any
man
not
be
estimated
beyond
their
deserts
but
with
him
believe
does
not
often
happen
world
blinded
by
his
fortune
consequence
or
frightened
by
his
high
imposing
manners
sees
him
only
as
he
chooses
to
be
seen
take
him
even
on
my
slight
acquaintance
to
be
an
ill
tempered
man
wickham
only
shook
his
head
wonder
said
he
at
next
opportunity
speaking
whether
he
likely
to
be
in
country
much
longer
do
not
at
know
but
heard
nothing
his
going
away
when
was
at
netherfield
hope
your
plans
in
favour
shire
will
not
be
affected
by
his
being
in
neighbourhood
oh
no
not
for
me
to
be
driven
away
by
mr
darcy
if
he
wishes
to
avoid
seeing
me
he
must
go
we
not
on
friendly
terms
always
gives
me
pain
to
meet
him
but
no
reason
for
avoiding
him
but
what
might
proclaim
before
world
sense
very
great
ill
usage
most
painful
regrets
at
his
being
what
he
his
father
miss
bennet
late
mr
darcy
was
one
best
men
that
ever
breathed
truest
friend
ever
had
can
never
be
in
company
with
mr
darcy
without
being
grieved
to
soul
by
thousand
tender
recollections
his
behaviour
to
myself
has
been
scandalous
but
verily
believe
could
forgive
him
anything
everything
rather
than
his
disappointing
hopes
disgracing
memory
his
father
elizabeth
found
interest
subject
increase
listened
with
her
heart
but
delicacy
prevented
further
inquiry
mr
wickham
began
to
speak
on
more
general
topics
meryton
neighbourhood
society
appearing
highly
pleased
with
that
he
had
yet
seen
speaking
latter
with
gentle
but
very
intelligible
gallantry
was
prospect
constant
society
good
society
he
added
which
was
my
chief
inducement
to
enter
shire
knew
to
be
most
respectable
agreeable
corps
my
friend
denny
tempted
me
further
by
his
account
their
present
quarters
very
great
attentions
excellent
acquaintances
meryton
had
procured
them
society
own
necessary
to
me
been
disappointed
man
my
spirits
will
not
bear
solitude
must
employment
society
military
life
not
what
was
intended
for
but
circumstances
now
made
eligible
church
ought
to
been
my
profession
was
brought
up
for
church
at
time
been
in
possession
most
valuable
living
had
pleased
gentleman
we
were
speaking
just
now
indeed
yes
late
mr
darcy
bequeathed
me
next
presentation
best
living
in
his
gift
he
was
my
godfather
excessively
attached
to
me
cannot
do
justice
to
his
kindness
he
meant
to
provide
for
me
amply
thought
he
had
done
but
when
living
fell
was
given
elsewhere
good
heavens
cried
elizabeth
but
how
could
that
be
how
could
his
will
be
disregarded
why
did
you
not
seek
legal
redress
there
was
just
such
an
informality
in
terms
bequest
as
to
give
me
no
hope
from
law
man
honour
could
not
doubted
intention
but
mr
darcy
chose
to
doubt
or
to
treat
as
merely
conditional
recommendation
to
assert
that
had
forfeited
claim
to
by
extravagance
imprudence
in
short
anything
or
nothing
certain
that
living
became
vacant
two
years
ago
exactly
as
was
an
age
to
hold
that
was
given
to
another
man
no
less
certain
that
cannot
accuse
myself
having
really
done
anything
to
deserve
to
lose
warm
unguarded
temper
may
spoken
my
opinion
him
to
him
too
freely
can
recall
nothing
worse
but
fact
that
we
very
different
sort
men
that
he
hates
me
quite
shocking
he
deserves
to
be
publicly
disgraced
some
time
or
other
he
will
be
but
shall
not
be
by
me
till
can
forget
his
father
can
never
defy
or
expose
him
elizabeth
honoured
him
for
such
feelings
thought
him
handsomer
than
ever
as
he
expressed
them
but
what
said
she
after
pause
can
been
his
motive
what
can
induced
him
to
behave
so
cruelly
thorough
determined
dislike
me
dislike
which
cannot
but
attribute
in
some
measure
to
jealousy
had
late
mr
darcy
liked
me
less
his
son
might
borne
with
me
better
but
his
father
s
uncommon
attachment
to
me
irritated
him
believe
very
early
in
life
he
had
not
temper
to
bear
sort
competition
in
which
we
stood
sort
preference
which
was
often
given
me
had
not
thought
mr
darcy
so
bad
as
though
never
liked
him
had
not
thought
so
very
ill
him
had
supposed
him
to
be
despising
his
fellow
creatures
in
general
but
did
not
suspect
him
descending
to
such
malicious
revenge
such
injustice
such
inhumanity
as
after
few
minutes
reflection
however
she
continued
do
remember
his
boasting
one
day
at
netherfield
implacability
his
resentments
his
having
an
unforgiving
temper
his
disposition
must
be
dreadful
will
not
trust
myself
on
subject
replied
wickham
can
hardly
be
just
to
him
elizabeth
was
again
deep
in
thought
after
time
exclaimed
to
treat
in
such
manner
godson
friend
favourite
his
father
she
could
added
young
man
too
like
you
whose
very
countenance
may
vouch
for
your
being
amiable
but
she
contented
herself
with
one
too
who
had
probably
been
his
companion
from
childhood
connected
together
as
think
you
said
in
closest
manner
we
were
born
in
same
parish
within
same
park
greatest
part
our
youth
was
passed
together
inmates
same
house
sharing
same
amusements
objects
same
parental
care
my
father
began
life
in
profession
which
your
uncle
mr
phillips
appears
to
do
so
much
credit
to
but
he
gave
up
everything
to
be
use
to
late
mr
darcy
devoted
his
time
to
care
pemberley
property
he
was
most
highly
esteemed
by
mr
darcy
most
intimate
confidential
friend
mr
darcy
often
acknowledged
himself
to
be
under
greatest
obligations
to
my
father
s
active
superintendence
when
immediately
before
my
father
s
death
mr
darcy
gave
him
voluntary
promise
providing
for
me
convinced
that
he
felt
to
be
as
much
debt
gratitude
to
him
as
his
affection
to
myself
how
strange
cried
elizabeth
how
abominable
wonder
that
very
pride
mr
darcy
has
not
made
him
just
to
you
if
from
no
better
motive
that
he
not
been
too
proud
to
be
dishonest
for
dishonesty
must
call
wonderful
replied
wickham
for
almost
his
actions
may
be
traced
to
pride
pride
had
often
been
his
best
friend
has
connected
him
nearer
with
virtue
than
with
any
other
feeling
but
we
none
us
consistent
in
his
behaviour
to
me
there
were
stronger
impulses
even
than
pride
can
such
abominable
pride
as
his
ever
done
him
good
yes
has
often
led
him
to
be
liberal
generous
to
give
his
money
freely
to
display
hospitality
to
assist
his
tenants
relieve
poor
family
pride
filial
pride
for
he
very
proud
what
his
father
was
done
not
to
appear
to
disgrace
his
family
to
degenerate
from
popular
qualities
or
lose
influence
pemberley
house
powerful
motive
he
has
also
brotherly
pride
which
with
some
brotherly
affection
makes
him
very
kind
careful
guardian
his
sister
you
will
hear
him
generally
cried
up
as
most
attentive
best
brothers
what
sort
girl
miss
darcy
he
shook
his
head
wish
could
call
her
amiable
gives
me
pain
to
speak
ill
darcy
but
she
too
much
like
her
brother
very
very
proud
as
child
she
was
affectionate
pleasing
extremely
fond
me
devoted
hours
hours
to
her
amusement
but
she
nothing
to
me
now
she
handsome
girl
about
fifteen
or
sixteen
understand
highly
accomplished
since
her
father
s
death
her
home
has
been
london
where
lady
lives
with
her
superintends
her
education
after
many
pauses
many
trials
other
subjects
elizabeth
could
not
help
reverting
once
more
to
first
saying
astonished
at
his
intimacy
with
mr
bingley
how
can
mr
bingley
who
seems
good
humour
itself
really
believe
truly
amiable
be
in
friendship
with
such
man
how
can
they
suit
each
other
do
you
know
mr
bingley
not
at
he
sweet
tempered
amiable
charming
man
he
cannot
know
what
mr
darcy
probably
not
but
mr
darcy
can
please
where
he
chooses
he
does
not
want
abilities
he
can
be
conversible
companion
if
he
thinks
worth
his
while
among
those
who
at
his
equals
in
consequence
he
very
different
man
from
what
he
to
less
prosperous
his
pride
never
deserts
him
but
with
rich
he
liberal
minded
just
sincere
rational
honourable
perhaps
agreeable
allowing
something
for
fortune
figure
whist
party
soon
afterwards
breaking
up
players
gathered
round
other
table
mr
collins
took
his
station
between
his
cousin
elizabeth
mrs
phillips
usual
inquiries
as
to
his
success
was
made
by
latter
had
not
been
very
great
he
had
lost
every
point
but
when
mrs
phillips
began
to
express
her
concern
thereupon
he
assured
her
with
much
earnest
gravity
that
was
not
least
importance
that
he
considered
money
as
mere
trifle
begged
that
she
would
not
make
herself
uneasy
know
very
well
madam
said
he
that
when
persons
sit
down
to
card
table
they
must
take
their
chances
these
things
happily
not
in
such
circumstances
as
to
make
five
shillings
any
object
there
undoubtedly
many
who
could
not
say
same
but
thanks
to
lady
catherine
de
bourgh
removed
far
beyond
necessity
regarding
little
matters
mr
wickham
s
attention
was
caught
after
observing
mr
collins
for
few
moments
he
asked
elizabeth
in
low
voice
whether
her
relation
was
very
intimately
acquainted
with
family
de
bourgh
lady
catherine
de
bourgh
she
replied
has
very
lately
given
him
living
hardly
know
how
mr
collins
was
first
introduced
to
her
notice
but
he
certainly
has
not
known
her
long
you
know
course
that
lady
catherine
de
bourgh
lady
anne
darcy
were
sisters
consequently
that
she
aunt
to
present
mr
darcy
no
indeed
did
not
knew
nothing
at
lady
catherine
s
connections
never
heard
her
existence
till
day
before
yesterday
her
daughter
miss
de
bourgh
will
very
large
fortune
believed
that
she
her
cousin
will
unite
two
estates
information
made
elizabeth
smile
as
she
thought
poor
miss
bingley
vain
indeed
must
be
her
attentions
vain
useless
her
affection
for
his
sister
her
praise
himself
if
he
were
already
self
destined
for
another
mr
collins
said
she
speaks
highly
both
lady
catherine
her
daughter
but
from
some
particulars
that
he
has
related
her
ladyship
suspect
his
gratitude
misleads
him
that
in
spite
her
being
his
patroness
she
an
arrogant
conceited
woman
believe
her
to
be
both
in
great
degree
replied
wickham
not
seen
her
for
many
years
but
very
well
remember
that
never
liked
her
that
her
manners
were
dictatorial
insolent
she
has
reputation
being
remarkably
sensible
clever
but
rather
believe
she
derives
part
her
abilities
from
her
rank
fortune
part
from
her
authoritative
manner
rest
from
pride
for
her
nephew
who
chooses
that
everyone
connected
with
him
an
understanding
first
class
elizabeth
allowed
that
he
had
given
very
rational
account
they
continued
talking
together
with
mutual
satisfaction
till
supper
put
an
end
to
cards
gave
rest
ladies
their
share
mr
wickham
s
attentions
there
could
be
no
conversation
in
noise
mrs
phillips
s
supper
party
but
his
manners
recommended
him
to
everybody
whatever
he
said
was
said
well
whatever
he
did
done
gracefully
elizabeth
went
away
with
her
head
full
him
she
could
think
nothing
but
mr
wickham
what
he
had
told
her
way
home
but
there
was
not
time
for
her
even
to
mention
his
name
as
they
went
for
neither
lydia
nor
mr
collins
were
once
silent
lydia
talked
incessantly
lottery
tickets
fish
she
had
lost
fish
she
had
won

in
describing

his
losses
at

chapter
elizabeth
related
to
jane
next
day
what
had
passed
between
mr
wickham
herself
jane
listened
with
astonishment
concern
she
knew
not
how
to
believe
that
mr
darcy
could
be
so
unworthy
mr
bingley
s
regard
yet
was
not
in
her
nature
to
question
veracity
young
man
such
amiable
appearance
as
wickham
possibility
his
having
endured
such
unkindness
was
enough
to
interest
her
tender
feelings
nothing
remained
therefore
to
be
done
but
to
think
well
them
both
to
defend
conduct
each
throw
into
account
accident
or
mistake
whatever
could
not
be
otherwise
explained
they
both
said
she
been
deceived
dare
say
in
some
way
or
other
which
we
can
form
no
idea
interested
people
perhaps
misrepresented
each
to
other
in
short
impossible
for
us
to
conjecture
causes
or
circumstances
which
may
alienated
them
without
actual
blame
on
either
side
very
true
indeed
now
my
dear
jane
what
you
got
to
say
on
behalf
interested
people
who
probably
been
concerned
in
business
do
clear
them
too
or
we
shall
be
obliged
to
think
ill
somebody
laugh
as
much
as
you
choose
but
you
will
not
laugh
me
out
my
opinion
my
dearest
lizzy
do
but
consider
in
what
disgraceful
light
places
mr
darcy
to
be
treating
his
father
s
favourite
in
such
manner
one
whom
his
father
had
promised
to
provide
for
impossible
no
man
common
humanity
no
man
who
had
any
value
for
his
character
could
be
capable
can
his
most
intimate
friends
be
so
excessively
deceived
in
him
oh
no
can
much
more
easily
believe
mr
bingley
s
being
imposed
on
than
that
mr
wickham
invent
such
history
himself
as
he
gave
me
last
night
names
facts
everything
mentioned
without
ceremony
if
be
not
so
let
mr
darcy
contradict
besides
there
was
truth
in
his
looks
difficult
indeed
distressing
one
does
not
know
what
to
think
beg
your
pardon
one
knows
exactly
what
to
think
but
jane
could
think
with
certainty
on
only
one
point
that
mr
bingley
if
he
had
been
imposed
on
would
much
to
suffer
when
affair
became
public
two
young
ladies
were
summoned
from
shrubbery
where
conversation
passed
by
arrival
very
persons
whom
they
had
been
speaking
mr
bingley
his
sisters
came
to
give
their
personal
invitation
for
long
expected
ball
at
netherfield
which
was
fixed
for
following
tuesday
two
ladies
were
delighted
to
see
their
dear
friend
again
called
an
age
since
they
had
met
repeatedly
asked
what
she
had
been
doing
with
herself
since
their
separation
to
rest
family
they
paid
little
attention
avoiding
mrs
bennet
as
much
as
possible
saying
not
much
to
elizabeth
nothing
at
to
others
they
were
soon
gone
again
rising
from
their
seats
with
an
activity
which
took
their
brother
by
surprise
hurrying
off
as
if
eager
to
escape
from
mrs
bennet
s
civilities
prospect
netherfield
ball
was
extremely
agreeable
to
every
female
family
mrs
bennet
chose
to
consider
as
given
in
compliment
to
her
eldest
daughter
was
particularly
flattered
by
receiving
invitation
from
mr
bingley
himself
instead

jane

to

happy
evening
in

her

her
brother
elizabeth
thought
with
pleasure
dancing
great
deal
with
mr
wickham
seeing
confirmation
everything
in
mr
darcy
s
look
behavior
happiness
anticipated
by
catherine
lydia
depended
less
on
any
single
event
or
any
particular
person
for
though
they
each
like
elizabeth
meant
to
dance
half
evening
with
mr
wickham
he
was
by
no
means
only
partner
who
could
satisfy
them
ball
was
at
any
rate
ball
even
mary
could
assure
her
family
that
she
had
no
disinclination
for
while
can
my
mornings
to
myself
said
she
enough
think
no
sacrifice
to
join
occasionally
in
evening
engagements
society
has
claims
on
us
profess
myself
one
those
who
consider
intervals
recreation
amusement
as
desirable
for
everybody
elizabeth
s
spirits
were
so
high
on
occasion
that
though
she
did
not
often
speak
unnecessarily
to
mr
collins
she
could
not
help
asking
him
whether
he
intended
to
accept
mr
bingley
s
invitation
if
he
did
whether
he
would
think
proper
to
join
in
evening
s
amusement
she
was
rather
surprised
to
find
that
he
entertained
no
scruple
whatever
on
that
head
was
very
far
from
dreading
rebuke
either
from
archbishop
or
lady
catherine
de
bourgh
by
venturing
to
dance
by
no
means
opinion
assure
you
said
he
that
ball
kind
given
by
young
man
character
to
respectable
people
can
any
evil
tendency
so
far
from
objecting
to
dancing
myself
that
shall
hope
to
be
honoured
with
hands
my
fair
cousins
in
course
evening
take
opportunity
soliciting
yours
miss
elizabeth
for
two
first
dances
especially
preference
which
trust
my
cousin
jane
will
attribute
to
right
cause
not
to
any
disrespect
for
her
elizabeth
felt
herself
completely
taken
in
she
had
fully
proposed
being
engaged
by
mr
wickham
for
those
very
dances
to
mr
collins
instead
her
liveliness
had
never
been
worse
timed
there
was
no
help
for
however
mr
wickham
s
happiness
her
own
were
perforce
delayed
little
longer
mr
collins
s
proposal
accepted
with
as
good
grace
as
she
could
she
was
not
better
pleased
with
his
gallantry
from
idea
suggested
something
more
now
first
struck
her
that
she
was
selected
from
among
her
sisters
as
worthy
being
mistress
hunsford
parsonage
assisting
to
form
quadrille
table
at
rosings
in
absence
more
eligible
visitors
idea
soon
reached
to
conviction
as
she
observed
his
increasing
civilities
toward
herself
heard
his
frequent
attempt
at
compliment
on
her
wit
vivacity
though
more
astonished
than
gratified
herself
by
effect
her
charms
was
not
long
before
her
mother
gave
her
to
understand
that
probability
their
marriage
was
extremely
agreeable
to
her
elizabeth
however
did
not
choose
to
take
hint
being
well
aware
that
serious
dispute
must
be
consequence
any
reply
mr
collins
might
never
make
offer
till
he
did
was
useless
to
quarrel
about
him
if
there
had
not
been
netherfield
ball
to
prepare
for
talk
younger
miss
bennets
would
been
in
very
pitiable
state
at
time
for
from
day
invitation
to
day
ball
there
was
such
succession
rain
as
prevented
their
walking
to
meryton
once
no
aunt
no
officers
no
news
could
be
sought
after
very
shoe
roses
for
netherfield
were
got
by
proxy
even
elizabeth
might
found
some
trial
her
patience
in
weather
which
totally
suspended
improvement
her
acquaintance
with
mr
wickham
nothing
less
than
dance
on
tuesday
could
made
such
friday
saturday
sunday
monday
endurable
to
kitty
lydia
chapter
till
elizabeth
entered
drawing
room
at
netherfield
looked
in
vain
for
mr
wickham
among
cluster
red
coats
there
assembled
doubt
his
being
present
had
never
occurred
to
her
certainty
meeting
him
had
not
been
checked
by
any
those
recollections
that
might
not
unreasonably
alarmed
her
she
had
dressed
with
more
than
usual
care
prepared
in
highest
spirits
for
conquest
that
remained
unsubdued
his
heart
trusting
that
was
not
more
than
might
be
won
in
course
evening
but
in
an
instant
arose
dreadful
suspicion
his
being
purposely
omitted
for
mr
darcy
s
pleasure
in
bingleys
invitation
to
officers
though
was
not
exactly
case
absolute
fact
his
absence
was
pronounced
by
his
friend
denny
to
whom
lydia
eagerly
applied
who
told
them
that
wickham
had
been
obliged
to
go
to
town
on
business
day
before
was
not
yet
returned
adding
with
significant
smile
do
not
imagine
his
business
would
called
him
away
just
now
if
he
had
not
wanted
to
avoid
certain
gentleman
here
part
his
intelligence
though
unheard
by
lydia
was
caught
by
elizabeth
as
assured
her
that
darcy
was
not
less
answerable
for
wickham
s
absence
than
if
her
first
surmise
had
been
just
every
feeling
displeasure
against
former
was
so
sharpened
by
immediate
disappointment
that
she
could
hardly
reply
with
tolerable
civility
to
polite
inquiries
which
he
directly
afterwards
approached
to
make
attendance
forbearance
patience
with
darcy
was
injury
to
wickham
she
was
resolved
against
any
sort
conversation
with
him
turned
away
with
degree
ill
humour
which
she
could
not
wholly
surmount
even
in
speaking
to
mr
bingley
whose
blind
partiality
provoked
her
but
elizabeth
was
not
formed
for
ill
humour
though
every
prospect
her
own
was
destroyed
for
evening
could
not
dwell
long
on
her
spirits
having
told
her
griefs
to
charlotte
lucas
whom
she
had
not
seen
for
week
she
was
soon
able
to
make
voluntary
transition
to
oddities
her
cousin
to
point
him
out
to
her
particular
notice
first
two
dances
however
brought
return
distress
they
were
dances
mortification
mr
collins
awkward
solemn
apologising
instead
attending
often
moving
wrong
without
being
aware
gave
her
shame
misery
which
disagreeable
partner
for
couple
dances
can
give
moment
her
release
from
him
was
ecstasy
she
danced
next
with
an
officer
had
refreshment
talking
wickham
hearing
that
he
was
universally
liked
when
those
dances
were
over
she
returned
to
charlotte
lucas
was
in
conversation
with
her
when
she
found
herself
suddenly
addressed
by
mr
darcy
who
took
her
so
much
by
surprise
in
his
application
for
her
hand
that
without
knowing
what
she
did
she
accepted
him
he
walked
away
again
immediately
she
was
left
to
fret
over
her
own
want
presence
mind
charlotte
tried
to
console
her
dare
say
you
will
find
him
very
agreeable
heaven
forbid
that
would
be
greatest
misfortune
to
find
man
agreeable
whom
one
determined
to
hate
do
not
wish
me
such
an
evil
when
dancing
recommenced
however
darcy
approached
to
claim
her
hand
charlotte
could
not
help
cautioning
her
in
whisper
not
to
be
simpleton
allow
her
fancy
for
wickham
to
make
her
appear
unpleasant
in
eyes
man
ten
times
his
consequence
elizabeth
made
no
answer
took
her
place
in
set
amazed
at
dignity
to
which
she
was
arrived
in
being
allowed
to
stand
opposite
to
mr
darcy
reading
in
her
neighbours
looks
their
equal
amazement
in
beholding
they
stood
for
some
time
without
speaking
word
she
began
to
imagine
that
their
silence
was
to
last
through
two
dances
at
first
was
resolved
not
to
break
till
suddenly
fancying
that
would
be
greater
punishment
to
her
partner
to
oblige
him
to
talk
she
made
some
slight
observation
on
dance
he
replied
was
again
silent
after
pause
some
minutes
she
addressed
him
time
with
your
turn
to
say
something
now
mr
darcy
talked
about
dance
you
ought
to
make
some
sort
remark
on
size
room
or
number
couples
he
smiled
assured
her
that
whatever
she
wished
him
to
say
be
said
very
well
that
reply
will
do
for
present
perhaps
by
by
may
observe
that
private
balls
much
pleasanter
than
public
ones
but
now
we
may
be
silent
do
you
talk
by
rule
then
while
you
dancing
sometimes
one
must
speak
little
you
know
would
look
odd
to
be
entirely
silent
for
half
an
hour
together
yet
for
advantage
some
conversation
ought
to
be
so
arranged
as
that
they
may
trouble
saying
as
little
as
possible
you
consulting
your
own
feelings
in
present
case
or
do
you
imagine
that
you
gratifying
mine
both
replied
elizabeth
archly
for
always
seen
great
similarity
in
turn
our
minds
we
each
an
unsocial
taciturn
disposition
unwilling
to
speak
unless
we
expect
to
say
something
that
will
amaze
whole
room
be
handed
down
to
posterity
with
eclat
proverb
no
very
striking
resemblance
your
own
character
sure
said
he
how
near
may
be
to
mine
cannot
pretend
to
say
you
think
faithful
portrait
undoubtedly
must
not
decide
on
my
own
performance
he
made
no
answer
they
were
again
silent
till
they
had
gone
down
dance
when
he
asked
her
if
she
her
sisters
did
not
very
often
walk
to
meryton
she
answered
in
affirmative
unable
to
resist
temptation
added
when
you
met
us
there
other
day
we
had
just
been
forming
new
acquaintance
effect
was
immediate
deeper
shade
hauteur
overspread
his
features
but
he
said
not
word
elizabeth
though
blaming
herself
for
her
own
weakness
could
not
go
on
at
length
darcy
spoke
in
constrained
manner
said
mr
wickham
blessed
with
such
happy
manners
as
may
ensure
his
making
friends
whether
he
may
be
equally
capable
retaining
them
less
certain
he
has
been
so
unlucky
as
to
lose
your
friendship
replied
elizabeth
with
emphasis
in
manner
which
he
likely
to
suffer
from
his
life
darcy
made
no
answer
seemed
desirous
changing
subject
at
that
moment
sir
william
lucas
appeared
close
to
them
meaning
to
pass
through
set
to
other
side
room
but
on
perceiving
mr
darcy
he
stopped
with
bow
superior
courtesy
to
compliment
him
on
his
dancing
his
partner
been
most
highly
gratified
indeed
my
dear
sir
such
very
superior
dancing
not
often
seen
evident
that
you
belong
to
first
circles
allow
me
to
say
however
that
your
fair
partner
does
not
disgrace
you
that
must
hope
to
pleasure
often
repeated
especially
when
certain
desirable
event
my
dear
eliza
glancing
at
her
sister
bingley
shall
take
place
what
congratulations
will
then
flow
in
appeal
to
mr
darcy
but
let
me
not
interrupt
you
sir
you
will
not
thank
me
for
detaining
you
from
bewitching
converse
that
young
lady
whose
bright
eyes
also
upbraiding
me
latter
part
address
was
scarcely
heard
by
darcy
but
sir
william
s
allusion
to
his
friend
seemed
to
strike
him
forcibly
his
eyes
were
directed
with
very
serious
expression
towards
bingley
jane
who
were
dancing
together
recovering
himself
however
shortly
he
turned
to
his
partner
said
sir
william
s
interruption
has
made
me
forget
what
we
were
talking
do
not
think
we
were
speaking
at
sir
william
could
not
interrupted
two
people
in
room
who
had
less
to
say
for
themselves
we
tried
two
or
subjects
already
without
success
what
we
to
talk
next
cannot
imagine
what
think
you
books
said
he
smiling
books
oh
no
sure
we
never
read
same
or
not
with
same
feelings
sorry
you
think
so
but
if
that
be
case
there
can
at
least
be
no
want
subject
we
may
compare
our
different
opinions
no
cannot
talk
books
in
ball
room
my
head
always
full
something
else
present
always
occupies
you
in
such
scenes
does
said
he
with
look
doubt
yes
always
she
replied
without
knowing
what
she
said
for
her
thoughts
had
wandered
far
from
subject
as
soon
afterwards
appeared
by
her
suddenly
exclaiming
remember
hearing
you
once
say
mr
darcy
that
you
hardly
ever
forgave
that
your
resentment
once
created
was
unappeasable
you
very
cautious
suppose
as
to
its
being
created
said
he
with
firm
voice
never
allow
yourself
to
be
blinded
by
prejudice
hope
not
particularly
incumbent
on
those
who
never
change
their
opinion
to
be
secure
judging
properly
at
first
may
ask
to
what
these
questions
tend
merely
to
illustration
your
character
said
she
endeavouring
to
shake
off
her
gravity
trying
to
make
out
what
your
success
she
shook
her
head
do
not
get
on
at
hear
such
different
accounts
you
as
puzzle
me
exceedingly
can
readily
believe
answered
he
gravely
that
reports
may
vary
greatly
with
respect
to
me
could
wish
miss
bennet
that
you
were
not
to
sketch
my
character
at
present
moment
as
there
reason
to
fear
that
performance
would
reflect
no
credit
on
either
but
if
do
not
take
your
likeness
now
may
never
another
opportunity
would
by
no
means
suspend
any
pleasure
yours
he
coldly
replied
she
said
no
more
they
went
down
other
dance
parted
in
silence
on
each
side
dissatisfied
though
not
to
an
equal
degree
for
in
darcy
s
breast
there
was
tolerable
powerful
feeling
towards
her
which
soon
procured
her
pardon
directed
his
anger
against
another
they
had
not
long
separated
when
miss
bingley
came
towards
her
with
an
expression
civil
disdain
accosted
her
so
miss
eliza
hear
you
quite
delighted
with
george
wickham
your
sister
has
been
talking
to
me
about
him
asking
me
thousand
questions
find
that
young
man
quite
forgot
to
tell
you
among
his
other
communication
that
he
was
son
old
wickham
late
mr
darcy
s
steward
let
me
recommend
you
however
as
friend
not
to
give
implicit
confidence
to
his
assertions
for
as
to
mr
darcy
s
using
him
ill
perfectly
false
for
on
contrary
he
has
always
been
remarkably
kind
to
him
though
george
wickham
has
treated
mr
darcy
in
most
infamous
manner
do
not
know
particulars
but
know
very
well
that
mr
darcy
not
in
least
to
blame
that
he
cannot
bear
to
hear
george
wickham
mentioned
that
though
my
brother
thought
that
he
could
not
well
avoid
including
him
in
his
invitation
to
officers
he
was
excessively
glad
to
find
that
he
had
taken
himself
out
way
his
coming
into
country
at
most
insolent
thing
indeed
wonder
how
he
could
presume
to
do
pity
you
miss
eliza
for
discovery
your
favourite
s
guilt
but
really
considering
his
descent
one
could
not
expect
much
better
his
guilt
his
descent
appear
by
your
account
to
be
same
said
elizabeth
angrily
for
heard
you
accuse
him
nothing
worse
than
being
son
mr
darcy
s
steward
that
can
assure
you
he
informed
me
himself
beg
your
pardon
replied
miss
bingley
turning
away
with
sneer
excuse
my
interference
was
kindly
meant
insolent
girl
said
elizabeth
to
herself
you
much
mistaken
if
you
expect
to
influence
me
by
such
paltry
attack
as
see
nothing
in
but
your
own
wilful
ignorance
malice
mr
darcy
she
then
sought
her
eldest
sister
who
has
undertaken
to
make
inquiries
on
same
subject
bingley
jane
met
her
with
smile
such
sweet
complacency
glow
such
happy
expression
as
sufficiently
marked
how
well
she
was
satisfied
with
occurrences
evening
elizabeth
instantly
read
her
feelings
at
that
moment
solicitude
for
wickham
resentment
against
his
enemies
everything
else
gave
way
before
hope
jane
s
being
in
fairest
way
for
happiness
want
to
know
said
she
with
countenance
no
less
smiling
than
her
sister
s
what
you
learnt
about
mr
wickham
but
perhaps
you
been
too
pleasantly
engaged
to
think
any
person
in
which
case
you
may
be
sure
my
pardon
no
replied
jane
not
forgotten
him
but
nothing
satisfactory
to
tell
you
mr
bingley
does
not
know
whole
his
history
quite
ignorant
circumstances
which
principally
offended
mr
darcy
but
he
will
vouch
for
good
conduct
probity
honour
his
friend
perfectly
convinced
that
mr
wickham
has
deserved
much
less
attention
from
mr
darcy
than
he
has
received
sorry
to
say
by
his
account
as
well
as
his
sister
s
mr
wickham
by
no
means
respectable
young
man
afraid
he
has
been
very
imprudent
has
deserved
to
lose
mr
darcy
s
regard
mr
bingley
does
not
know
mr
wickham
himself
no
he
never
saw
him
till
other
morning
at
meryton
account
then
what
he
has
received
from
mr
darcy
satisfied
but
what
does
he
say
living
he
does
not
exactly
recollect
circumstances
though
he
has
heard
them
from
mr
darcy
more
than
once
but
he
believes
that
was
left
to
him
conditionally
only
not
doubt
mr
bingley
s
sincerity
said
elizabeth
warmly
but
you
must
excuse
my
not
being
convinced
by
assurances
only
mr
bingley
s
defense
his
friend
was
very
able
one
dare
say
but
since
he
unacquainted
with
several
parts
story
has
learnt
rest
from
that
friend
himself
shall
venture
to
still
think
both
gentlemen
as
did
before
she
then
changed
discourse
to
one
more
gratifying
to
each
on
which
there
could
be
no
difference
sentiment
elizabeth
listened
with
delight
to
happy
though
modest
hopes
which
jane
entertained
mr
bingley
s
regard
said
in
her
power
to
heighten
her
confidence
in
on
their
being
joined
by
mr
bingley
himself
elizabeth
withdrew
to
miss
lucas
to
whose
inquiry
after
pleasantness
her
last
partner
she
had
scarcely
replied
before
mr
collins
came
up
to
them
told
her
with
great
exultation
that
he
had
just
been
so
fortunate
as
to
make
most
important
discovery
found
out
said
he
by
singular
accident
that
there
now
in
room
near
relation
my
patroness
happened
to
overhear
gentleman
himself
mentioning
to
young
lady
who
does
honours
house
names
his
cousin
miss
de
bourgh
her
mother
lady
catherine
how
wonderfully
these
sort
things
occur
who
would
thought
my
meeting
with
perhaps
nephew
lady
catherine
de
bourgh
in
assembly
most
thankful
that
discovery
made
in
time
for
me
to
pay
my
respects
to
him
which
now
going
to
do
trust
he
will
excuse
my
not
having
done
before
my
total
ignorance
connection
must
plead
my
apology
you
not
going
to
introduce
yourself
to
mr
darcy
indeed
shall
entreat
his
pardon
for
not
having
done
earlier
believe
him
to
be
lady
catherine
s
nephew
will
be
in
my
power
to
assure
him
that
her
ladyship
was
quite
well
yesterday
se
nnight
elizabeth
tried
hard
to
dissuade
him
from
such
scheme
assuring
him
that
mr
darcy
would
consider
his
addressing
him
without
introduction
as
an
impertinent
freedom
rather
than
compliment
to
his
aunt
that
was
not
in
least
necessary
there
be
any
notice
on
either
side
that
if
were
must
belong
to
mr
darcy
superior
in
consequence
to
begin
acquaintance
mr
collins
listened
to
her
with
determined
air
following
his
own
inclination
when
she
ceased
speaking
replied
thus
my
dear
miss
elizabeth
highest
opinion
in
world
in
your
excellent
judgement
in
matters
within
scope
your
understanding
but
permit
me
to
say
that
there
must
be
wide
difference
between
established
forms
ceremony
amongst
laity
those
which
regulate
clergy
for
give
me
leave
to
observe
that
consider
clerical
office
as
equal
in
point
dignity
with
highest
rank
in
kingdom
provided
that
proper
humility
behaviour
at
same
time
maintained
you
must
therefore
allow
me
to
follow
dictates
my
conscience
on
occasion
which
leads
me
to
perform
what
look
on
as
point
duty
pardon
me
for
neglecting
to
profit
by
your
advice
which
on
every
other
subject
shall
be
my
constant
guide
though
in
case
before
us
consider
myself
more
fitted
by
education
habitual
study
to
decide
on
what
right
than
young
lady
like
yourself
with
low
bow
he
left
her
to
attack
mr
darcy
whose
reception
his
advances
she
eagerly
watched
whose
astonishment
at
being
so
addressed
was
very
evident
her
cousin
prefaced
his
speech
with
solemn
bow
though
she
could
not
hear
word
she
felt
as
if
hearing
saw
in
motion
his
lips
words
apology
hunsford
lady
catherine
de
bourgh
vexed
her
to
see
him
expose
himself
to
such
man
mr
darcy
was
eyeing
him
with
unrestrained
wonder
when
at
last
mr
collins
allowed
him
time
to
speak
replied
with
an
air
distant
civility
mr
collins
however
was
not
discouraged
from
speaking
again
mr
darcy
s
contempt
seemed
abundantly
increasing
with
length
his
speech
at
end
he
only
made
him
slight
bow
moved
another
way
mr
collins
then
returned
to
elizabeth
no
reason
assure
you
said
he
to
be
dissatisfied
with
my
reception
mr
darcy
seemed
much
pleased
with
attention
he
answered
me
with
utmost
civility
even
paid
me
compliment
saying
that
he
was
so
well
convinced
lady
catherine
s
discernment
as
to
be
certain
she
could
never
bestow
favour
unworthily
was
really
very
handsome
thought
upon
whole
much
pleased
with
him
as
elizabeth
had
no
longer
any
interest
her
own
to
pursue
she
turned
her
attention
almost
entirely
on
her
sister
mr
bingley
train
agreeable
reflections
which
her
observations
gave
birth
to
made
her
perhaps
almost
as
happy
as
jane
she
saw
her
in
idea
settled
in
that
very
house
in
felicity
which
marriage
true
affection
could
bestow
she
felt
capable
under
such
circumstances
endeavouring
even
to
like
bingley
s
two
sisters
her
mother
s
thoughts
she
plainly
saw
were
bent
same
way
she
determined
not
to
venture
near
her
lest
she
might
hear
too
much
when
they
sat
down
to
supper
therefore
she
considered
most
unlucky
perverseness
which
placed
them
within
one
each
other
deeply
was
she
vexed
to
find
that
her
mother
was
talking
to
that
one
person
lady
lucas
freely
openly
nothing
else
but
her
expectation
that
jane
would
soon
be
married
to
mr
bingley
was
an
animating
subject
mrs
bennet
seemed
incapable
fatigue
while
enumerating
advantages
match
his
being
such
charming
young
man
so
rich
living
but
miles
from
them
were
first
points
self
gratulation
then
was
such
comfort
to
think
how
fond
two
sisters
were
jane
to
be
certain
that
they
must
desire
connection
as
much
as
she
could
do
was
moreover
such
promising
thing
for
her
younger
daughters
as
jane
s
marrying
so
greatly
must
throw
them
in
way
other
rich
men
lastly
was
so
pleasant
at
her
time
life
to
be
able
to
consign
her
single
daughters
to
care
their
sister
that
she
might
not
be
obliged
to
go
into
company
more
than
she
liked
was
necessary
to
make
circumstance
matter
pleasure
because
on
such
occasions
etiquette
but
no
one
was
less
likely
than
mrs
bennet
to
find
comfort
in
staying
home
at
any
period
her
life
she
concluded
with
many
good
wishes
that
lady
lucas
might
soon
be
equally
fortunate
though
evidently
triumphantly
believing
there
was
no
chance
in
vain
did
elizabeth
endeavour
to
check
rapidity
her
mother
s
words
or
persuade
her
to
describe
her
felicity
in
less
audible
whisper
for
to
her
inexpressible
vexation
she
could
perceive
that
chief
was
overheard
by
mr
darcy
who
sat
opposite
to
them
her
mother
only
scolded
her
for
being
nonsensical
what
mr
darcy
to
me
pray
that
be
afraid
him
sure
we
owe
him
no
such
particular
civility
as
to
be
obliged
to
say
nothing
he
may
not
like
to
hear
for
heaven
s
sake
madam
speak
lower
what
advantage
can
be
for
you
to
offend
mr
darcy
you
will
never
recommend
yourself
to
his
friend
by
so
doing
nothing
that
she
could
say
however
had
any
influence
her
mother
would
talk
her
views
in
same
intelligible
tone
elizabeth
blushed
blushed
again
with
shame
vexation
she
could
not
help
frequently
glancing
her
eye
at
mr
darcy
though
every
glance
convinced
her
what
she
dreaded
for
though
he
was
not
always
looking
at
her
mother
she
was
convinced
that
his
attention
was
invariably
fixed
by
her
expression
his
face
changed
gradually
from
indignant
contempt
to
composed
steady
gravity
at
length
however
mrs
bennet
had
no
more
to
say
lady
lucas
who
had
been
long
yawning
at
repetition
delights
which
she
saw
no
likelihood
sharing
was
left
to
comforts
cold
ham
chicken
elizabeth
now
began
to
revive
but
not
long
was
interval
tranquillity
for
when
supper
was
over
singing
was
talked
she
had
mortification
seeing
mary
after
very
little
entreaty
preparing
to
oblige
company
by
many
significant
looks
silent
entreaties
did
she
endeavour
to
prevent
such
proof
complaisance
but
in
vain
mary
would
not
understand
them
such
an
opportunity
exhibiting
was
delightful
to
her
she
began
her
song
elizabeth
s
eyes
were
fixed
on
her
with
most
painful
sensations
she
watched
her
progress
through
several
stanzas
with
an
impatience
which
was
very
ill
rewarded
at
their
close
for
mary
on
receiving
amongst
thanks
table
hint
hope
that
she
might
be
prevailed
on
to
favour
them
again
after
pause
half
minute
began
another
mary
s
powers
were
by
no
means
fitted
for
such
display
her
voice
was
weak
her
manner
affected
elizabeth
was
in
agonies
she
looked
at
jane
to
see
how
she
bore
but
jane
was
very
composedly
talking
to
bingley
she
looked
at
his
two
sisters
saw
them
making
signs
derision
at
each
other
at
darcy
who
continued
however
imperturbably
grave
she
looked
at
her
father
to
entreat
his
interference
lest
mary
be
singing
night
he
took
hint
when
mary
had
finished
her
song
said
aloud
that
will
do
extremely
well
child
you
delighted
us
long
enough
let
other
young
ladies
time
to
exhibit
mary
though
pretending
not
to
hear
was
somewhat
disconcerted
elizabeth
sorry
for
her
sorry
for
her
father
s
speech
was
afraid
her
anxiety
had
done
no
good
others
party
were
now
applied
to
if
said
mr
collins
were
so
fortunate
as
to
be
able
to
sing
great
pleasure
sure
in
obliging
company
with
an
air
for
consider
music
as
very
innocent
diversion
perfectly
compatible
with
profession
clergyman
do
not
mean
however
to
assert
that
we
can
be
justified
in
devoting
too
much
our
time
to
music
for
there
certainly
other
things
to
be
attended
to
rector
parish
has
much
to
do
in
first
place
he
must
make
such
an
agreement
for
tithes
as
may
be
beneficial
to
himself
not
offensive
to
his
patron
he
must
write
his
own
sermons
time
that
remains
will
not
be
too
much
for
his
parish
duties
care
improvement
his
dwelling
which
he
cannot
be
excused
from
making
as
comfortable
as
possible
do
not
think
light
importance
that
he
attentive
conciliatory
manner
towards
everybody
especially
towards
those
to
whom
he
owes
his
preferment
cannot
acquit
him
that
duty
nor
could
think
well
man
who
omit
an
occasion
testifying
his
respect
towards
anybody
connected
with
family
with
bow
to
mr
darcy
he
concluded
his
speech
which
had
been
spoken
so
loud
as
to
be
heard
by
half
room
many
stared
many
smiled
but
no
one
looked
more
amused
than
mr
bennet
himself
while
his
wife
seriously
commended
mr
collins
for
having
spoken
so
sensibly
observed
in
half
whisper
to
lady
lucas
that
he
was
remarkably
clever
good
kind
young
man
to
elizabeth
appeared
that
had
her
family
made
an
agreement
to
expose
themselves
as
much
as
they
could
during
evening
would
been
impossible
for
them
to
play
their
parts
with
more
spirit
or
finer
success
happy
did
she
think
for
bingley
her
sister
that
some
exhibition
had
escaped
his
notice
that
his
feelings
were
not
sort
to
be
much
distressed
by
folly
which
he
must
witnessed
that
his
two
sisters
mr
darcy
however
such
an
opportunity
ridiculing
her
relations
was
bad
enough
she
could
not
determine
whether
silent
contempt
gentleman
or
insolent
smiles
ladies
were
more
intolerable
rest
evening
brought
her
little
amusement
she
was
teased
by
mr
collins
who
continued
most
perseveringly
by
her
side
though
he
could
not
prevail
on
her
to
dance
with
him
again
put
out
her
power
to
dance
with
others
in
vain
did
she
entreat
him
to
stand
up
with
somebody
else
offer
to
introduce
him
to
any
young
lady
in
room
he
assured
her
that
as
to
dancing
he
was
perfectly
indifferent
to
that
his
chief
object
was
by
delicate
attentions
to
recommend
himself
to
her
that
he
therefore
make
point
remaining
close
to
her
whole
evening
there
was
no
arguing
upon
such
project
she
owed
her
greatest
relief
to
her
friend
miss
lucas
who
often
joined
them
good
naturedly
engaged
mr
collins
s
conversation
to
herself
she
was
at
least
from
offense
mr
darcy
s
further
notice
though
often
standing
within
very
short
distance
her
quite
disengaged
he
never
came
near
enough
to
speak
she
felt
to
be
probable
consequence
her
allusions
to
mr
wickham
rejoiced
in
longbourn
party
were
last
company
to
depart
by
manoeuvre
mrs
bennet
had
to
wait
for
their
carriage
quarter
an
hour
after
everybody
else
was
gone
which
gave
them
time
to
see
how
heartily
they
were
wished
away
by
some
family
mrs
hurst
her
sister
scarcely
opened
their
mouths
except
to
complain
fatigue
were
evidently
impatient
to
house
to
themselves
they
repulsed
every
attempt
mrs
bennet
at
conversation
by
so
doing
threw
languor
over
whole
party
which
was
very
little
relieved
by
long
speeches
mr
collins
who
was
complimenting
mr
bingley
his
sisters
on
elegance
their
entertainment
hospitality
politeness
which
had
marked
their
behaviour
to
their
guests
darcy
said
nothing
at
mr
bennet
in
equal
silence
was
enjoying
scene
mr
bingley
jane
were
standing
together
little
detached
from
rest
talked
only
to
each
other
elizabeth
preserved
as
steady
silence
as
either
mrs
hurst
or
miss
bingley
even
lydia
was
too
much
fatigued
to
utter
more
than
occasional
exclamation
lord
how
tired
accompanied
by
violent
yawn
when
at
length
they
arose
to
take
leave
mrs
bennet
was
most
pressingly
civil
in
her
hope
seeing
whole
family
soon
at
longbourn
addressed
herself
especially
to
mr
bingley
to
assure
him
how
happy
he
would
make
them
by
eating
family
dinner
with
them
at
any
time
without
ceremony
formal
invitation
bingley
was
grateful
pleasure
he
readily
engaged
for
taking
earliest
opportunity
waiting
on
her
after
his
return
from
london
whither
he
was
obliged
to
go
next
day
for
short
time
mrs
bennet
was
perfectly
satisfied
quitted
house
under
delightful
persuasion
that
allowing
for
necessary
preparations
settlements
new
carriages
wedding
clothes
she
undoubtedly
see
her
daughter
settled
at
netherfield
in
course
or
four
months
having
another
daughter
married
to
mr
collins
she
thought
with
equal
certainty
with
considerable
though
not
equal
pleasure
elizabeth
was
least
dear
to
her
her
children
though
man
match
were
quite
good
enough
for
her
worth
each
was
eclipsed
by
mr
bingley
netherfield
chapter
next
day
opened
new
scene
at
longbourn
mr
collins
made
his
declaration
in
form
having
resolved
to
do
without
loss
time
as
his
leave
absence
extended
only
to
following
saturday
having
no
feelings
diffidence
to
make
distressing
to
himself
even
at
moment
he
set
about
in
very
orderly
manner
with
observances
which
he
supposed
regular
part
business
on
finding
mrs
bennet
elizabeth
one
younger
girls
together
soon
after
breakfast
he
addressed
mother
in
these
words
may
hope
madam
for
your
interest
with
your
fair
daughter
elizabeth
when
solicit
for
honour
private
audience
with
her
in
course
morning
before
elizabeth
had
time
for
anything
but
blush
surprise
mrs
bennet
answered
instantly
oh
dear
yes
certainly
sure
lizzy
will
be
very
happy
sure
she
can
no
objection
come
kitty
want
you
upstairs
gathering
her
work
together
she
was
hastening
away
when
elizabeth
called
out
dear
madam
do
not
go
beg
you
will
not
go
mr
collins
must
excuse
me
he
can
nothing
to
say
to
me
that
anybody
need
not
hear
going
away
myself
no
no
nonsense
lizzy
desire
you
to
stay
where
you
upon
elizabeth
s
seeming
really
with
vexed
embarrassed
looks
about
to
escape
she
added
lizzy
insist
upon
your
staying
hearing
mr
collins
elizabeth
would
not
oppose
such
an
injunction
moment
s
consideration
making
her
also
sensible
that
would
be
wisest
to
get
over
as
soon
as
quietly
as
possible
she
sat
down
again
tried
to
conceal
by
incessant
employment
feelings
which
were
divided
between
distress
diversion
mrs
bennet
kitty
walked
off
as
soon
as
they
were
gone
mr
collins
began
believe
me
my
dear
miss
elizabeth
that
your
modesty
so
far
from
doing
you
any
disservice
rather
adds
to
your
other
perfections
you
would
been
less
amiable
in
my
eyes
had
there
not
been
little
unwillingness
but
allow
me
to
assure
you
that
your
respected
mother
s
permission
for
address
you
can
hardly
doubt
purport
my
discourse
however
your
natural
delicacy
may
lead
you
to
dissemble
my
attentions
been
too
marked
to
be
mistaken
almost
as
soon
as
entered
house
singled
you
out
as
companion
my
future
life
but
before
run
away
with
by
my
feelings
on
subject
perhaps
would
be
advisable
for
me
to
state
my
reasons
for
marrying
moreover
for
coming
into
hertfordshire
with
design
selecting
wife
as
certainly
did
idea
mr
collins
with
his
solemn
composure
being
run
away
with
by
his
feelings
made
elizabeth
so
near
laughing
that
she
could
not
use
short
pause
he
allowed
in
any
attempt
to
stop
him
further
he
continued
my
reasons
for
marrying
first
that
think
right
thing
for
every
clergyman
in
easy
circumstances
like
myself
to
set
example
matrimony
in
his
parish
secondly
that
convinced
that
will
add
very
greatly
to
my
happiness
thirdly
which
perhaps
ought
to
mentioned
earlier
that
particular
advice
recommendation
very
noble
lady
whom
honour
calling
patroness
twice
has
she
condescended
to
give
me
her
opinion
unasked
too
on
subject
was
but
very
saturday
night
before
left
hunsford
between
our
pools
at
quadrille
while
mrs
jenkinson
was
arranging
miss
de
bourgh
s
footstool
that
she
said
mr
collins
you
must
marry
clergyman
like
you
must
marry
choose
properly
choose
gentlewoman
for
my
sake
for
your
own
let
her
be
an
active
useful
sort
person
not
brought
up
high
but
able
to
make
small
income
go
good
way
my
advice
find
such
woman
as
soon
as
you
can
bring
her
to
hunsford
will
visit
her
allow
me
by
way
to
observe
my
fair
cousin
that
do
not
reckon
notice
kindness
lady
catherine
de
bourgh
as
among
least
advantages
in
my
power
to
offer
you
will
find
her
manners
beyond
anything
can
describe
your
wit
vivacity
think
must
be
acceptable
to
her
especially
when
tempered
with
silence
respect
which
her
rank
will
inevitably
excite
thus
much
for
my
general
intention
in
favour
matrimony
remains
to
be
told
why
my
views
were
directed
towards
longbourn
instead
my
own
neighbourhood
where
can
assure
you
there
many
amiable
young
women
but
fact
that
being
as
to
inherit
estate
after
death
your
honoured
father
who
however
may
live
many
years
longer
could
not
satisfy
myself
without
resolving
to
choose
wife
from
among
his
daughters
that
loss
to
them
might
be
as
little
as
possible
when
melancholy
event
takes
place
which
however
as
already
said
may
not
be
for
several
years
has
been
my
motive
my
fair
cousin
flatter
myself
will
not
sink
me
in
your
esteem
now
nothing
remains
for
me
but
to
assure
you
in
most
animated
language
violence
my
affection
to
fortune
perfectly
indifferent
shall
make
no
demand
that
nature
on
your
father
since
well
aware
that
could
not
be
complied
with
that
one
thousand
pounds
in
four
per
cents
which
will
not
be
yours
till
after
your
mother
s
decease
that
you
may
ever
be
entitled
to
on
that
head
therefore
shall
be
uniformly
silent
you
may
assure
yourself
that
no
ungenerous
reproach
shall
ever
pass
my
lips
when
we
married
was
absolutely
necessary
to
interrupt
him
now
you
too
hasty
sir
she
cried
you
forget
that
made
no
answer
let
me
do
without
further
loss
time
accept
my
thanks
for
compliment
you
paying
me
very
sensible
honour
your
proposals
but
impossible
for
me
to
do
otherwise
than
to
decline
them
not
now
to
learn
replied
mr
collins
with
formal
wave
hand
that
usual
with
young
ladies
to
reject
addresses
man
whom
they
secretly
mean
to
accept
when
he
first
applies
for
their
favour
that
sometimes
refusal
repeated
or
even
time
therefore
by
no
means
discouraged
by
what
you
just
said
shall
hope
to
lead
you
to
altar
ere
long
upon
my
word
sir
cried
elizabeth
your
hope
rather
extraordinary
one
after
my
declaration
do
assure
you
that
not
one
those
young
ladies
if
such
young
ladies
there
who
so
daring
as
to
risk
their
happiness
on
chance
being
asked
time
perfectly
serious
in
my
refusal
you
could
not
make
me
happy
convinced
that
last
woman
in
world
who
could
make
you
so
nay
were
your
friend
lady
catherine
to
know
me
persuaded
she
would
find
me
in
every
respect
ill
qualified
for
situation
were
certain
that
lady
catherine
would
think
so
said
mr
collins
very
gravely
but
cannot
imagine
that
her
ladyship
would
at
disapprove
you
you
may
be
certain
when
honour
seeing
her
again
shall
speak
in
very
highest
terms
your
modesty
economy
other
amiable
qualification
indeed
mr
collins
praise
me
will
be
unnecessary
you
must
give
me
leave
to
judge
for
myself
pay
me
compliment
believing
what
say
wish
you
very
happy
very
rich
by
refusing
your
hand
do
in
my
power
to
prevent
your
being
otherwise
in
making
me
offer
you
must
satisfied
delicacy
your
feelings
with
regard
to
my
family
may
take
possession
longbourn
estate
whenever
falls
without
any
self
reproach
matter
may
be
considered
therefore
as
finally
settled
rising
as
she
thus
spoke
she
would
quitted
room
had
mr
collins
not
thus
addressed
her
when
do
myself
honour
speaking
to
you
next
on
subject
shall
hope
to
receive
more
favourable
answer
than
you
now
given
me
though
far
from
accusing
you
cruelty
at
present
because
know
to
be
established
custom
your
sex
to
reject
man
on
first
application
perhaps
you
even
now
said
as
much
to
encourage
my
suit
as
would
be
consistent
with
true
delicacy
female
character
really
mr
collins
cried
elizabeth
with
some
warmth
you
puzzle
me
exceedingly
if
what
hitherto
said
can
appear
to
you
in
form
encouragement
know
not
how
to
express
my
refusal
in
such
way
as
to
convince
you
its
being
one
you
must
give
me
leave
to
flatter
myself
my
dear
cousin
that
your
refusal
my
addresses
merely
words
course
my
reasons
for
believing
briefly
these
does
not
appear
to
me
that
my
hand
unworthy
your
acceptance
or
that
establishment
can
offer
would
be
any
other
than
highly
desirable
my
situation
in
life
my
connections
with
family
de
bourgh
my
relationship
to
your
own
circumstances
highly
in
my
favour
you
take
into
further
consideration
that
in
spite
your
manifold
attractions
by
no
means
certain
that
another
offer
marriage
may
ever
be
made
you
your
portion
unhappily
so
small
that
will
in
likelihood
undo
effects
your
loveliness
amiable
qualifications
as
must
therefore
conclude
that
you
not
serious
in
your
rejection
me
shall
choose
to
attribute
to
your
wish
increasing
my
love
by
suspense
according
to
usual
practice
elegant
females
do
assure
you
sir
that
no
pretensions
whatever
to
that
kind
elegance
which
consists
in
tormenting
respectable
man
would
rather
be
paid
compliment
being
believed
sincere
thank
you
again
again
for
honour
you
done
me
in
your
proposals
but
to
accept
them
absolutely
impossible
my
feelings
in
every
respect
forbid
can
speak
plainer
do
not
consider
me
now
as
an
elegant
female
intending
to
plague
you
but
as
rational
creature
speaking
truth
from
her
heart
you
uniformly
charming
cried
he
with
an
air
awkward
gallantry
persuaded
that
when
sanctioned
by
express
authority
both
your
excellent
parents
my
proposals
will
not
fail
being
acceptable
to
such
perseverance
in
wilful
self
deception
elizabeth
would
make
no
reply
immediately
in
silence
withdrew
determined
if
he
persisted
in
considering
her
repeated
refusals
as
flattering
encouragement
to
apply
to
her
father
whose
negative
might
be
uttered
in
such
manner
as
to
be
decisive
whose
behavior
at
least
could
not
be
mistaken
for
affectation
coquetry
an
elegant
female
chapter
mr
collins
was
not
left
long
to
silent
contemplation
his
successful
love
for
mrs
bennet
having
dawdled
about
in
vestibule
to
watch
for
end
conference
no
sooner
saw
elizabeth
open
door
with
quick
step
pass
her
towards
staircase
than
she
entered
breakfast
room
congratulated
both
him
herself
in
warm
terms
on
happy
prospect
or
their
nearer
connection
mr
collins
received
returned
these
felicitations
with
equal
pleasure
then
proceeded
to
relate
particulars
their
interview
with
result
which
he
trusted
he
had
every
reason
to
be
satisfied
since
refusal
which
his
cousin
had
steadfastly
given
him
would
naturally
flow
from
her
bashful
modesty
genuine
delicacy
her
character
information
however
startled
mrs
bennet
she
would
been
glad
to
be
equally
satisfied
that
her
daughter
had
meant
to
encourage
him
by
protesting
against
his
proposals
but
she
dared
not
believe
could
not
help
saying
so
but
depend
upon
mr
collins
she
added
that
lizzy
shall
be
brought
to
reason
will
speak
to
her
about
directly
she
very
headstrong
foolish
girl
does
not
know
her
own
interest
but
will
make
her
know
pardon
me
for
interrupting
you
madam
cried
mr
collins
but
if
she
really
headstrong
foolish
know
not
whether
she
would
altogether
be
very
desirable
wife
to
man
in
my
situation
who
naturally
looks
for
happiness
in
marriage
state
if
therefore
she
actually
persists
in
rejecting
my
suit
perhaps
were
better
not
to
force
her
into
accepting
me
because
if
liable
to
such
defects
temper
she
could
not
contribute
much
to
my
felicity
sir
you
quite
misunderstand
me
said
mrs
bennet
alarmed
lizzy
only
headstrong
in
such
matters
as
these
in
everything
else
she
as
good
natured
girl
as
ever
lived
will
go
directly
to
mr
bennet
we
shall
very
soon
settle
with
her
sure
she
would
not
give
him
time
to
reply
but
hurrying
instantly
to
her
husband
called
out
as
she
entered
library
oh
mr
bennet
you
wanted
immediately
we
in
an
uproar
you
must
come
make
lizzy
marry
mr
collins
for
she
vows
she
will
not
him
if
you
do
not
make
haste
he
will
change
his
mind
not
her
mr
bennet
raised
his
eyes
from
his
book
as
she
entered
fixed
them
on
her
face
with
calm
unconcern
which
was
not
in
least
altered
by
her
communication
not
pleasure
understanding
you
said
he
when
she
had
finished
her
speech
what
you
talking
mr
collins
lizzy
lizzy
declares
she
will
not
mr
collins
mr
collins
begins
to
say
that
he
will
not
lizzy
what
to
do
on
occasion
seems
an
hopeless
business
speak
to
lizzy
about
yourself
tell
her
that
you
insist
upon
her
marrying
him
let
her
be
called
down
she
shall
hear
my
opinion
mrs
bennet
rang
bell
miss
elizabeth
was
summoned
to
library
come
here
child
cried
her
father
as
she
appeared
sent
for
you
on
an
affair
importance
understand
that
mr
collins
has
made
you
an
offer
marriage
true
elizabeth
replied
that
was
very
well
offer
marriage
you
refused
sir
very
well
we
now
come
to
point
your
mother
insists
upon
your
accepting
not
so
mrs
bennet
yes
or
will
never
see
her
again
an
unhappy
alternative
before
you
elizabeth
from
day
you
must
be
stranger
to
one
your
parents
your
mother
will
never
see
you
again
if
you
do
not
marry
mr
collins
will
never
see
you
again
if
you
do
elizabeth
could
not
but
smile
at
such
conclusion
such
beginning
but
mrs
bennet
who
had
persuaded
herself
that
her
husband
regarded
affair
as
she
wished
was
excessively
disappointed
what
do
you
mean
mr
bennet
in
talking
way
you
promised
me
to
insist
upon
her
marrying
him
my
dear
replied
her
husband
two
small
favours
to
request
first
that
you
will
allow
me
use
my
understanding
on
present
occasion
secondly
my
room
shall
be
glad
to
library
to
myself
as
soon
as
may
be
not
yet
however
in
spite
her
disappointment
in
her
husband
did
mrs
bennet
give
up
point
she
talked
to
elizabeth
again
again
coaxed
threatened
her
by
turns
she
endeavoured
to
secure
jane
in
her
interest
but
jane
with
possible
mildness
declined
interfering
elizabeth
sometimes
with
real
earnestness
sometimes
with
playful
gaiety
replied
to
her
attacks
though
her
manner
varied
however
her
determination
never
did
mr
collins
meanwhile
was
meditating
in
solitude
on
what
had
passed
he
thought
too
well
himself
to
comprehend
on
what
motives
his
cousin
could
refuse
him
though
his
pride
was
hurt
he
suffered
in
no
other
way
his
regard
for
her
was
quite
imaginary
possibility
her
deserving
her
mother
s
reproach
prevented
his
feeling
any
regret
while
family
were
in
confusion
charlotte
lucas
came
to
spend
day
with
them
she
was
met
in
vestibule
by
lydia
who
flying
to
her
cried
in
half
whisper
glad
you
come
for
there
such
fun
here
what
do
you
think
has
happened
morning
mr
collins
has
made
an
offer
to
lizzy
she
will
not
him
charlotte
hardly
had
time
to
answer
before
they
were
joined
by
kitty
who
came
to
tell
same
news
no
sooner
had
they
entered
breakfast
room
where
mrs
bennet
was
alone
than
she
likewise
began
on
subject
calling
on
miss
lucas
for
her
compassion
entreating
her
to
persuade
her
friend
lizzy
to
comply
with
wishes
her
family
pray
do
my
dear
miss
lucas
she
added
in
melancholy
tone
for
nobody
on
my
side
nobody
takes
part
with
me
cruelly
used
nobody
feels
for
my
poor
nerves
charlotte
s
reply
was
spared
by
entrance
jane
elizabeth
aye
there
she
comes
continued
mrs
bennet
looking
as
unconcerned
as
may
be
caring
no
more
for
us
than
if
we
were
at
york
provided
she
can
her
own
way
but
tell
you
miss
lizzy
if
you
take
into
your
head
to
go
on
refusing
every
offer
marriage
in
way
you
will
never
get
husband
at
sure
do
not
know
who
to
maintain
you
when
your
father
dead
shall
not
be
able
to
keep
you
so
warn
you
done
with
you
from
very
day
told
you
in
library
you
know
that
never
speak
to
you
again
you
will
find
me
as
good
as
my
word
no
pleasure
in
talking
to
undutiful
children
not
that
much
pleasure
indeed
in
talking
to
anybody
people
who
suffer
as
do
from
nervous
complaints
can
no
great
inclination
for
talking
nobody
can
tell
what
suffer
but
always
so
those
who
do
not
complain
never
pitied
her
daughters
listened
in
silence
to
effusion
sensible
that
any
attempt
to
reason
with
her
or
soothe
her
would
only
increase
irritation
she
talked
on
therefore
without
interruption
from
any
them
till
they
were
joined
by
mr
collins
who
entered
room
with
an
air
more
stately
than
usual
on
perceiving
whom
she
said
to
girls
now
do
insist
upon
that
you
you
hold
your
tongues
let
me
mr
collins
little
conversation
together
elizabeth
passed
quietly
out
room
jane
kitty
followed
but
lydia
stood
her
ground
determined
to
hear
she
could
charlotte
detained
first
by
civility
mr
collins
whose
inquiries
after
herself
her
family
were
very
minute
then
by
little
curiosity
satisfied
herself
with
walking
to
window
pretending
not
to
hear
in
doleful
voice
mrs
bennet
began
projected
conversation
oh
mr
collins
my
dear
madam
replied
he
let
us
be
for
ever
silent
on
point
far
be
from
me
he
presently
continued
in
voice
that
marked
his
displeasure
to
resent
behaviour
your
daughter
resignation
to
inevitable
evils
evil
duty
us
peculiar
duty
young
man
who
has
been
so
fortunate
as
been
in
early
preferment
trust
resigned
perhaps
not
less
so
from
feeling
doubt
my
positive
happiness
had
my
fair
cousin
honoured
me
with
her
hand
for
often
observed
that
resignation
never
so
perfect
as
when
blessing
denied
begins
to
lose
somewhat
its
value
in
our
estimation
you
will
not
hope
consider
me
as
showing
any
disrespect
to
your
family
my
dear
madam
by
thus
withdrawing
my
pretensions
to
your
daughter
s
favour
without
having
paid
yourself
mr
bennet
compliment
requesting
you
to
interpose
your
authority
in
my
behalf
my
conduct
may
fear
be
objectionable
in
having
accepted
my
dismission
from
your
daughter
s
lips
instead
your
own
but
we
liable
to
error
certainly
meant
well
through
whole
affair
my
object
has
been
to
secure
an
amiable
companion
for
myself
with
due
consideration
for
advantage
your
family
if
my
manner
has
been
at
reprehensible
here
beg
leave
to
apologise
chapter
discussion
mr
collins
s
offer
was
now
nearly
at
an
end
elizabeth
had
only
to
suffer
from
uncomfortable
feelings
necessarily
attending
occasionally
from
some
peevish
allusions
her
mother
as
for
gentleman
himself
his
feelings
were
chiefly
expressed
not
by
embarrassment
or
dejection
or
by
trying
to
avoid
her
but
by
stiffness
manner
resentful
silence
he
scarcely
ever
spoke
to
her
assiduous
attentions
which
he
had
been
so
sensible
himself
were
transferred
for
rest
day
to
miss
lucas
whose
civility
in
listening
to
him
was
seasonable
relief
to
them
especially
to
her
friend
morrow
produced
no
abatement
mrs
bennet
s
ill
humour
or
ill
health
mr
collins
was
also
in
same
state
angry
pride
elizabeth
had
hoped
that
his
resentment
might
shorten
his
visit
but
his
plan
did
not
appear
in
least
affected
by
he
was
always
to
gone
on
saturday
to
saturday
he
meant
to
stay
after
breakfast
girls
walked
to
meryton
to
inquire
if
mr
wickham
were
returned
to
lament
over
his
absence
from
netherfield
ball
he
joined
them
on
their
entering
town
attended
them
to
their
aunt
s
where
his
regret
vexation
concern
everybody
was
well
talked
over
to
elizabeth
however
he
voluntarily
acknowledged
that
necessity
his
absence
had
been
self
imposed
found
said
he
as
time
drew
near
that
had
better
not
meet
mr
darcy
that
to
be
in
same
room
same
party
with
him
for
so
many
hours
together
might
be
more
than
could
bear
that
scenes
might
arise
unpleasant
to
more
than
myself
she
highly
approved
his
forbearance
they
had
leisure
for
full
discussion
for
commendation
which
they
civilly
bestowed
on
each
other
as
wickham
another
officer
walked
back
with
them
to
longbourn
during
walk
he
particularly
attended
to
her
his
accompanying
them
was
double
advantage
she
felt
compliment
offered
to
herself
was
most
acceptable
as
an
occasion
introducing
him
to
her
father
mother
soon
after
their
return
letter
was
delivered
to
miss
bennet
came
from
netherfield
envelope
contained
sheet
elegant
little
hot
pressed
paper
well
covered
with
lady
s
fair
flowing
hand
elizabeth
saw
her
sister
s
countenance
change
as
she
read
saw
her
dwelling
intently
on
some
particular
passages
jane
recollected
herself
soon
putting
letter
away
tried
to
join
with
her
usual
cheerfulness
in
general
conversation
but
elizabeth
felt
an
anxiety
on
subject
which
drew
off
her
attention
even
from
wickham
no
sooner
had
he
his
companion
taken
leave
than
glance
from
jane
invited
her
to
follow
her
upstairs
when
they
had
gained
their
own
room
jane
taking
out
letter
said
from
caroline
bingley
what
contains
has
surprised
me
good
deal
whole
party
left
netherfield
by
time
on
their
way
to
town
without
any
intention
coming
back
again
you
shall
hear
what
she
says
she
then
read
first
sentence
aloud
which
comprised
information
their
having
just
resolved
to
follow
their
brother
to
town
directly
their
meaning
to
dine
in
grosvenor
street
where
mr
hurst
had
house
next
was
in
these
words
do
not
pretend
to
regret
anything
shall
leave
in
hertfordshire
except
your
society
my
dearest
friend
but
we
will
hope
at
some
future
period
to
enjoy
many
returns
that
delightful
intercourse
we
known
in
meanwhile
may
lessen
pain
separation
by
very
frequent
most
unreserved
correspondence
depend
on
you
for
that
to
these
highflown
expressions
elizabeth
listened
with
insensibility
distrust
though
suddenness
their
removal
surprised
her
she
saw
nothing
in
really
to
lament
was
not
to
be
supposed
that
their
absence
from
netherfield
would
prevent
mr
bingley
s
being
there
as
to
loss
their
society
she
was
persuaded
that
jane
must
cease
to
regard
in
enjoyment
his
unlucky
said
she
after
short
pause
that
you
not
be
able
to
see
your
friends
before
they
leave
country
but
may
we
not
hope
that
period
future
happiness
to
which
miss
bingley
looks
forward
may
arrive
earlier
than
she
aware
that
delightful
intercourse
you
known
as
friends
will
be
renewed
with
yet
greater
satisfaction
as
sisters
mr
bingley
will
not
be
detained
in
london
by
them
caroline
decidedly
says
that
none
party
will
return
into
hertfordshire
winter
will
read
to
you
when
my
brother
left
us
yesterday
he
imagined
that
business
which
took
him
to
london
might
be
concluded
in
or
four
days
but
as
we
certain
cannot
be
so
at
same
time
convinced
that
when
charles
gets
to
town
he
will
be
in
no
hurry
to
leave
again
we
determined
on
following
him
thither
that
he
may
not
be
obliged
to
spend
his
vacant
hours
in
comfortless
hotel
many
my
acquaintances
already
there
for
winter
wish
that
could
hear
that
you
my
dearest
friend
had
any
intention
making
one
crowd
but
that
despair
sincerely
hope
your
christmas
in
hertfordshire
may
abound
in
gaieties
which
that
season
generally
brings
that
your
beaux
will
be
so
numerous
as
to
prevent
your
feeling
loss
whom
we
shall
deprive
you
evident
by
added
jane
that
he
comes
back
no
more
winter
only
evident
that
miss
bingley
does
not
mean
that
he
why
will
you
think
so
must
be
his
own
doing
he
his
own
master
but
you
do
not
know
will
read
you
passage
which
particularly
hurts
me
will
no
reserves
from
you
mr
darcy
impatient
to
see
his
sister
to
confess
truth
we
scarcely
less
eager
to
meet
her
again
really
do
not
think
georgiana
darcy
has
her
equal
for
beauty
elegance
accomplishments
affection
she
inspires
in
louisa
myself
heightened
into
something
still
more
interesting
from
hope
we
dare
entertain
her
being
hereafter
our
sister
do
not
know
whether
ever
before
mentioned
to
you
my
feelings
on
subject
but
will
not
leave
country
without
confiding
them
trust
you
will
not
esteem
them
unreasonable
my
brother
admires
her
greatly
already
he
will
frequent
opportunity
now
seeing
her
on
most
intimate
footing
her
relations
wish
connection
as
much
as
his
own
sister
s
partiality
not
misleading
me
think
when
call
charles
most
capable
engaging
any
woman
s
heart
with
these
circumstances
to
favour
an
attachment
nothing
to
prevent
wrong
my
dearest
jane
in
indulging
hope
an
event
which
will
secure
happiness
so
many
what
do
you
think
sentence
my
dear
lizzy
said
jane
as
she
finished
not
clear
enough
does
not
expressly
declare
that
caroline
neither
expects
nor
wishes
me
to
be
her
sister
that
she
perfectly
convinced
her
brother
s
indifference
that
if
she
suspects
nature
my
feelings
for
him
she
means
most
kindly
to
put
me
on
my
guard
can
there
be
any
other
opinion
on
subject
yes
there
can
for
mine
totally
different
will
you
hear
most
willingly
you
shall
in
few
words
miss
bingley
sees
that
her
brother
in
love
with
you
wants
him
to
marry
miss
darcy
she
follows
him
to
town
in
hope
keeping
him
there
tries
to
persuade
you
that
he
does
not
care
about
you
jane
shook
her
head
indeed
jane
you
ought
to
believe
me
no
one
who
has
ever
seen
you
together
can
doubt
his
affection
miss
bingley
sure
cannot
she
not
such
simpleton
could
she
seen
half
as
much
love
in
mr
darcy
for
herself
she
would
ordered
her
wedding
clothes
but
case
we
not
rich
enough
or
grand
enough
for
them
she
more
anxious
to
get
miss
darcy
for
her
brother
from
notion
that
when
there
has
been
one
intermarriage
she
may
less
trouble
in
achieving
in
which
there
certainly
some
ingenuity
dare
say
would
succeed
if
miss
de
bourgh
were
out
way
but
my
dearest
jane
you
cannot
seriously
imagine
that
because
miss
bingley
tells
you
her
brother
greatly
admires
miss
darcy
he
in
smallest
degree
less
sensible
your
merit
than
when
he
took
leave
you
on
tuesday
or
that
will
be
in
her
power
to
persuade
him
that
instead
being
in
love
with
you
he
very
much
in
love
with
her
friend
if
we
thought
alike
miss
bingley
replied
jane
your
representation
might
make
me
quite
easy
but
know
foundation
unjust
caroline
incapable
wilfully
deceiving
anyone
that
can
hope
in
case
that
she
deceiving
herself
that
right
you
could
not
started
more
happy
idea
since
you
will
not
take
comfort
in
mine
believe
her
to
be
deceived
by
means
you
now
done
your
duty
by
her
must
fret
no
longer
but
my
dear
sister
can
be
happy
even
supposing
best
in
accepting
man
whose
sisters
friends
wishing
him
to
marry
elsewhere
you
must
decide
for
yourself
said
elizabeth
if
upon
mature
deliberation
you
find
that
misery
disobliging
his
two
sisters
more
than
equivalent
to
happiness
being
his
wife
advise
you
by
means
to
refuse
him
how
can
you
talk
so
said
jane
faintly
smiling
you
must
know
that
though
be
exceedingly
grieved
at
their
disapprobation
could
not
hesitate
did
not
think
you
would
that
being
case
cannot
consider
your
situation
with
much
compassion
but
if
he
returns
no
more
winter
my
choice
will
never
be
required
thousand
things
may
arise
in
six
months
idea
his
returning
no
more
elizabeth
treated
with
utmost
contempt
appeared
to
her
merely
suggestion
caroline
s
interested
wishes
she
could
not
for
moment
suppose
that
those
wishes
however
openly
or
artfully
spoken
could
influence
young
man
so
totally
independent
everyone
she
represented
to
her
sister
as
forcibly
as
possible
what
she
felt
on
subject
had
soon
pleasure
seeing
its
happy
effect
jane
s
temper
was
not
desponding
she
was
gradually
led
to
hope
though
diffidence
affection
sometimes
overcame
hope
that
bingley
would
return
to
netherfield
answer
every
wish
her
heart
they
agreed
that
mrs
bennet
only
hear
departure
family
without
being
alarmed
on
score
gentleman
s
conduct
but
even
partial
communication
gave
her
great
deal
concern
she
bewailed
as
exceedingly
unlucky
that
ladies
happen
to
go
away
just
as
they
were
getting
so
intimate
together
after
lamenting
however
at
some
length
she
had
consolation
that
mr
bingley
would
be
soon
down
again
soon
dining
at
longbourn
conclusion
was
comfortable
declaration
that
though
he
had
been
invited
only
to
family
dinner
she
would
take
care
to
two
full
courses
chapter
bennets
were
engaged
to
dine
with
lucases
again
during
chief
day
was
miss
lucas
so
kind
as
to
listen
to
mr
collins
elizabeth
took
an
opportunity
thanking
her
keeps
him
in
good
humour
said
she
more
obliged
to
you
than
can
express
charlotte
assured
her
friend
her
satisfaction
in
being
useful
that
amply
repaid
her
for
little
sacrifice
her
time
was
very
amiable
but
charlotte
s
kindness
extended
farther
than
elizabeth
had
any
conception
its
object
was
nothing
else
than
to
secure
her
from
any
return
mr
collins
s
addresses
by
engaging
them
towards
herself
such
was
miss
lucas
s
scheme
appearances
were
so
favourable
that
when
they
parted
at
night
she
would
felt
almost
secure
success
if
he
had
not
been
to
leave
hertfordshire
so
very
soon
but
here
she
did
injustice
to
fire
independence
his
character
for
led
him
to
escape
out
longbourn
house
next
morning
with
admirable
slyness
hasten
to
lucas
lodge
to
throw
himself
at
her
feet
he
was
anxious
to
avoid
notice
his
cousins
from
conviction
that
if
they
saw
him
depart
they
could
not
fail
to
conjecture
his
design
he
was
not
willing
to
attempt
known
till
its
success
might
be
known
likewise
for
though
feeling
almost
secure
with
reason
for
charlotte
had
been
tolerably
encouraging
he
was
comparatively
diffident
since
adventure
wednesday
his
reception
however
was
most
flattering
kind
miss
lucas
perceived
him
from
an
upper
window
as
he
walked
towards
house
instantly
set
out
to
meet
him
accidentally
in
lane
but
little
had
she
dared
to
hope
that
so
much
love
eloquence
awaited
her
there
in
as
short
time
as
mr
collins
s
long
speeches
would
allow
everything
was
settled
between
them
to
satisfaction
both
as
they
entered
house
he
earnestly
entreated
her
to
name
day
that
was
to
make
him
happiest
men
though
such
solicitation
must
be
waived
for
present
lady
felt
no
inclination
to
trifle
with
his
happiness
stupidity
with
which
he
was
favoured
by
nature
must
guard
his
courtship
from
any
charm
that
could
make
woman
wish
for
its
continuance
miss
lucas
who
accepted
him
solely
from
pure
disinterested
desire
an
establishment
cared
not
how
soon
that
establishment
were
gained
sir
william
lady
lucas
were
speedily
applied
to
for
their
consent
was
bestowed
with
most
joyful
alacrity
mr
collins
s
present
circumstances
made
most
eligible
match
for
their
daughter
to
whom
they
could
give
little
fortune
his
prospects
future
wealth
were
exceedingly
fair
lady
lucas
began
directly
to
calculate
with
more
interest
than
matter
had
ever
excited
before
how
many
years
longer
mr
bennet
was
likely
to
live
sir
william
gave
as
his
decided
opinion
that
whenever
mr
collins
be
in
possession
longbourn
estate
would
be
highly
expedient
that
both
he
his
wife
make
their
appearance
at
st
james
s
whole
family
in
short
were
properly
overjoyed
on
occasion
younger
girls
formed
hopes
coming
out
year
or
two
sooner
than
they
might
otherwise
done
boys
were
relieved
from
their
apprehension
charlotte
s
dying
an
old
maid
charlotte
herself
was
tolerably
composed
she
had
gained
her
point
had
time
to
consider
her
reflections
were
in
general
satisfactory
mr
collins
to
be
sure
was
neither
sensible
nor
agreeable
his
society
was
irksome
his
attachment
to
her
must
be
imaginary
but
still
he
would
be
her
husband
without
thinking
highly
either
men
or
matrimony
marriage
had
always
been
her
object
was
only
provision
for
well
educated
young
women
small
fortune
however
uncertain
giving
happiness
must
be
their
pleasantest
preservative
from
want
preservative
she
had
now
obtained
at
age
twenty
seven
without
having
ever
been
handsome
she
felt
good
luck
least
agreeable
circumstance
in
business
was
surprise
must
occasion
to
elizabeth
bennet
whose
friendship
she
valued
beyond
that
any
other
person
elizabeth
would
wonder
probably
would
blame
her
though
her
resolution
was
not
to
be
shaken
her
feelings
must
be
hurt
by
such
disapprobation
she
resolved
to
give
her
information
herself
therefore
charged
mr
collins
when
he
returned
to
longbourn
to
dinner
to
drop
no
hint
what
had
passed
before
any
family
promise
secrecy
was
course
very
dutifully
given
but
could
not
be
kept
without
difficulty
for
curiosity
excited
by
his
long
absence
burst
forth
in
such
very
direct
questions
on
his
return
as
required
some
ingenuity
to
evade
he
was
at
same
time
exercising
great
self
denial
for
he
was
longing
to
publish
his
prosperous
love
as
he
was
to
begin
his
journey
too
early
on
morrow
to
see
any
family
ceremony
leave
taking
was
performed
when
ladies
moved
for
night
mrs
bennet
with
great
politeness
cordiality
said
how
happy
they
be
to
see
him
at
longbourn
again
whenever
his
engagements
might
allow
him
to
visit
them
my
dear
madam
he
replied
invitation
particularly
gratifying
because
what
been
hoping
to
receive
you
may
be
very
certain
that
shall
avail
myself
as
soon
as
possible
they
were
astonished
mr
bennet
who
could
by
no
means
wish
for
so
speedy
return
immediately
said
but
there
not
danger
lady
catherine
s
disapprobation
here
my
good
sir
you
had
better
neglect
your
relations
than
run
risk
offending
your
patroness
my
dear
sir
replied
mr
collins
particularly
obliged
to
you
for
friendly
caution
you
may
depend
upon
my
not
taking
so
material
step
without
her
ladyship
s
concurrence
you
cannot
be
too
much
upon
your
guard
risk
anything
rather
than
her
displeasure
if
you
find
likely
to
be
raised
by
your
coming
to
us
again
which
think
exceedingly
probable
stay
quietly
at
home
be
satisfied
that
we
shall
take
no
offence
believe
me
my
dear
sir
my
gratitude
warmly
excited
by
such
affectionate
attention
depend
upon
you
will
speedily
receive
from
me
letter
thanks
for
for
every
other
mark
your
regard
during
my
stay
in
hertfordshire
as
for
my
fair
cousins
though
my
absence
may
not
be
long
enough
to
render
necessary
shall
now
take
liberty
wishing
them
health
happiness
not
excepting
my
cousin
elizabeth
with
proper
civilities
ladies
then
withdrew
them
equally
surprised
that
he
meditated
quick
return
mrs
bennet
wished
to
understand
by
that
he
thought
paying
his
addresses
to
one
her
younger
girls
mary
might
been
prevailed
on
to
accept
him
she
rated
his
abilities
much
higher
than
any
others
there
was
solidity
in
his
reflections
which
often
struck
her
though
by
no
means
so
clever
as
herself
she
thought
that
if
encouraged
to
read
improve
himself
by
such
an
example
as
hers
he
might
become
very
agreeable
companion
but
on
following
morning
every
hope
kind
was
done
away
miss
lucas
called
soon
after
breakfast
in
private
conference
with
elizabeth
related
event
day
before
possibility
mr
collins
s
fancying
himself
in
love
with
her
friend
had
once
occurred
to
elizabeth
within
last
day
or
two
but
that
charlotte
could
encourage
him
seemed
almost
as
far
from
possibility
as
she
could
encourage
him
herself
her
astonishment
was
consequently
so
great
as
to
overcome
at
first
bounds
decorum
she
could
not
help
crying
out
engaged
to
mr
collins
my
dear
charlotte
impossible
steady
countenance
which
miss
lucas
had
commanded
in
telling
her
story
gave
way
to
momentary
confusion
here
on
receiving
so
direct
reproach
though
as
was
no
more
than
she
expected
she
soon
regained
her
composure
calmly
replied
why
you
be
surprised
my
dear
eliza
do
you
think
incredible
that
mr
collins
be
able
to
procure
any
woman
s
good
opinion
because
he
was
not
so
happy
as
to
succeed
with
you
but
elizabeth
had
now
recollected
herself
making
strong
effort
for
was
able
to
assure
with
tolerable
firmness
that
prospect
their
relationship
was
highly
grateful
to
her
that
she
wished
her
imaginable
happiness
see
what
you
feeling
replied
charlotte
you
must
be
surprised
very
much
surprised
so
lately
as
mr
collins
was
wishing
to
marry
you
but
when
you
had
time
to
think
over
hope
you
will
be
satisfied
with
what
done
not
romantic
you
know
never
was
ask
only
comfortable
home
considering
mr
collins
s
character
connection
situation
in
life
convinced
that
my
chance
happiness
with
him
as
fair
as
most
people
can
boast
on
entering
marriage
state
elizabeth
quietly
answered
undoubtedly
after
an
awkward
pause
they
returned
to
rest
family
charlotte
did
not
stay
much
longer
elizabeth
was
then
left
to
reflect
on
what
she
had
heard
was
long
time
before
she
became
at
reconciled
to
idea
so
unsuitable
match
strangeness
mr
collins
s
making
two
offers
marriage
within
days
was
nothing
in
comparison
his
being
now
accepted
she
had
always
felt
that
charlotte
s
opinion
matrimony
was
not
exactly
like
her
own
but
she
had
not
supposed
to
be
possible
that
when
called
into
action
she
would
sacrificed
every
better
feeling
to
worldly
advantage
charlotte
wife
mr
collins
was
most
humiliating
picture
to
pang
friend
disgracing
herself
sunk
in
her
esteem
was
added
distressing
conviction
that
was
impossible
for
that
friend
to
be
tolerably
happy
in
lot
she
had
chosen
chapter
elizabeth
was
sitting
with
her
mother
sisters
reflecting
on
what
she
had
heard
doubting
whether
she
was
authorised
to
mention
when
sir
william
lucas
himself
appeared
sent
by
his
daughter
to
announce
her
engagement
to
family
with
many
compliments
to
them
much
self
gratulation
on
prospect
connection
between
houses
he
unfolded
matter
to
an
audience
not
merely
wondering
but
incredulous
for
mrs
bennet
with
more
perseverance
than
politeness
protested
he
must
be
entirely
mistaken
lydia
always
unguarded
often
uncivil
boisterously
exclaimed
good
lord
sir
william
how
can
you
tell
such
story
do
not
you
know
that
mr
collins
wants
to
marry
lizzy
nothing
less
than
complaisance
courtier
could
borne
without
anger
such
treatment
but
sir
william
s
good
breeding
carried
him
through
though
he
begged
leave
to
be
positive
as
to
truth
his
information
he
listened
to
their
impertinence
with
most
forbearing
courtesy
elizabeth
feeling
incumbent
on
her
to
relieve
him
from
so
unpleasant
situation
now
put
herself
forward
to
confirm
his
account
by
mentioning
her
prior
knowledge
from
charlotte
herself
endeavoured
to
put
stop
to
exclamations
her
mother
sisters
by
earnestness
her
congratulations
to
sir
william
in
which
she
was
readily
joined
by
jane
by
making
variety
remarks
on
happiness
that
might
be
expected
from
match
excellent
character
mr
collins
convenient
distance
hunsford
from
london
mrs
bennet
was
in
fact
too
much
overpowered
to
say
great
deal
while
sir
william
remained
but
no
sooner
had
he
left
them
than
her
feelings
found
rapid
vent
in
first
place
she
persisted
in
disbelieving
whole
matter
secondly
she
was
very
sure
that
mr
collins
had
been
taken
in
thirdly
she
trusted
that
they
would
never
be
happy
together
fourthly
that
match
might
be
broken
off
two
inferences
however
were
plainly
deduced
from
whole
one
that
elizabeth
was
real
cause
mischief
other
that
she
herself
had
been
barbarously
misused
by
them
on
these
two
points
she
principally
dwelt
during
rest
day
nothing
could
console
nothing
could
appease
her
nor
did
that
day
wear
out
her
resentment
week
elapsed
before
she
could
see
elizabeth
without
scolding
her
month
passed
away
before
she
could
speak
to
sir
william
or
lady
lucas
without
being
rude
many
months
were
gone
before
she
could
at
forgive
their
daughter
mr
bennet
s
emotions
were
much
more
tranquil
on
occasion
such
as
he
did
experience
he
pronounced
to
be
most
agreeable
sort
for
gratified
him
he
said
to
discover
that
charlotte
lucas
whom
he
had
been
used
to
think
tolerably
sensible
was
as
foolish
as
his
wife
more
foolish
than
his
daughter
jane
confessed
herself
little
surprised
at
match
but
she
said
less
her
astonishment
than
her
earnest
desire
for
their
happiness
nor
could
elizabeth
persuade
her
to
consider
as
improbable
kitty
lydia
were
far
from
envying
miss
lucas
for
mr
collins
was
only
clergyman
affected
them
in
no
other
way
than
as
piece
news
to
spread
at
meryton
lady
lucas
could
not
be
insensible
triumph
on
being
able
to
retort
on
mrs
bennet
comfort
having
daughter
well
married
she
called
at
longbourn
rather
oftener
than
usual
to
say
how
happy
she
was
though
mrs
bennet
s
sour
looks
ill
natured
remarks
might
been
enough
to
drive
happiness
away
between
elizabeth
charlotte
there
was
restraint
which
kept
them
mutually
silent
on
subject
elizabeth
felt
persuaded
that
no
real
confidence
could
ever
subsist
between
them
again
her
disappointment
in
charlotte
made
her
turn
with
fonder
regard
to
her
sister
whose
rectitude
delicacy
she
was
sure
her
opinion
could
never
be
shaken
for
whose
happiness
she
grew
daily
more
anxious
as
bingley
had
now
been
gone
week
nothing
more
was
heard
his
return
jane
had
sent
caroline
an
early
answer
to
her
letter
was
counting
days
till
she
might
reasonably
hope
to
hear
again
promised
letter
thanks
from
mr
collins
arrived
on
tuesday
addressed
to
their
father
written
with
solemnity
gratitude
which
twelvemonth
s
abode
in
family
might
prompted
after
discharging
his
conscience
on
that
head
he
proceeded
to
inform
them
with
many
rapturous
expressions
his
happiness
in
having
obtained
affection
their
amiable
neighbour
miss
lucas
then
explained
that
was
merely
with
view
enjoying
her
society
that
he
had
been
so
ready
to
close
with
their
kind
wish
seeing
him
again
at
longbourn
whither
he
hoped
to
be
able
to
return
on
monday
fortnight
for
lady
catherine
he
added
so
heartily
approved
his
marriage
that
she
wished
to
take
place
as
soon
as
possible
which
he
trusted
would
be
an
unanswerable
argument
with
his
amiable
charlotte
to
name
an
early
day
for
making
him
happiest
men
mr
collins
s
return
into
hertfordshire
was
no
longer
matter
pleasure
to
mrs
bennet
on
contrary
she
was
as
much
disposed
to
complain
as
her
husband
was
very
strange
that
he
come
to
longbourn
instead
to
lucas
lodge
was
also
very
inconvenient
exceedingly
troublesome
she
hated
having
visitors
in
house
while
her
health
was
so
indifferent
lovers
were
people
most
disagreeable
such
were
gentle
murmurs
mrs
bennet
they
gave
way
only
to
greater
distress
mr
bingley
s
continued
absence
neither
jane
nor
elizabeth
were
comfortable
on
subject
day
after
day
passed
away
without
bringing
any
other
tidings
him
than
report
which
shortly
prevailed
in
meryton
his
coming
no
more
to
netherfield
whole
winter
report
which
highly
incensed
mrs
bennet
which
she
never
failed
to
contradict
as
most
scandalous
falsehood
even
elizabeth
began
to
fear
not
that
bingley
was
indifferent
but
that
his
sisters
would
be
successful
in
keeping
him
away
unwilling
as
she
was
to
admit
an
idea
so
destructive
jane
s
happiness
so
dishonorable
to
stability
her
lover
she
could
not
prevent
its
frequently
occurring
united
efforts
his
two
unfeeling
sisters
his
overpowering
friend
assisted
by
attractions
miss
darcy
amusements
london
might
be
too
much
she
feared
for
strength
his
attachment
as
for
jane
her
anxiety
under
suspense
was
course
more
painful
than
elizabeth
s
but
whatever
she
felt
she
was
desirous
concealing
between
herself
elizabeth
therefore
subject
was
never
alluded
to
but
as
no
such
delicacy
restrained
her
mother
an
hour
seldom
passed
in
which
she
did
not
talk
bingley
express
her
impatience
for
his
arrival
or
even
require
jane
to
confess
that
if
he
did
not
come
back
she
would
think
herself
very
ill
used
needed
jane
s
steady
mildness
to
bear
these
attacks
with
tolerable
tranquillity
mr
collins
returned
most
punctually
on
monday
fortnight
but
his
reception
at
longbourn
was
not
quite
so
gracious
as
had
been
on
his
first
introduction
he
was
too
happy
however
to
need
much
attention
luckily
for
others
business
love
making
relieved
them
from
great
deal
his
company
chief
every
day
was
spent
by
him
at
lucas
lodge
he
sometimes
returned
to
longbourn
only
in
time
to
make
an
apology
for
his
absence
before
family
went
to
bed
mrs
bennet
was
really
in
most
pitiable
state
very
mention
anything
concerning
match
threw
her
into
an
agony
ill
humour
wherever
she
went
she
was
sure
hearing
talked
sight
miss
lucas
was
odious
to
her
as
her
successor
in
that
house
she
regarded
her
with
jealous
abhorrence
whenever
charlotte
came
to
see
them
she
concluded
her
to
be
anticipating
hour
possession
whenever
she
spoke
in
low
voice
to
mr
collins
was
convinced
that
they
were
talking
longbourn
estate
resolving
to
turn
herself
her
daughters
out
house
as
soon
as
mr
bennet
were
dead
she
complained
bitterly
to
her
husband
indeed
mr
bennet
said
she
very
hard
to
think
that
charlotte
lucas
ever
be
mistress
house
that
be
forced
to
make
way
for
her
live
to
see
her
take
her
place
in
my
dear
do
not
give
way
to
such
gloomy
thoughts
let
us
hope
for
better
things
let
us
flatter
ourselves
that
may
be
survivor
was
not
very
consoling
to
mrs
bennet
therefore
instead
making
any
answer
she
went
on
as
before
cannot
bear
to
think
that
they
estate
if
was
not
for
entail
not
mind
what
not
you
mind
not
mind
anything
at
let
us
be
thankful
that
you
preserved
from
state
such
insensibility
never
can
be
thankful
mr
bennet
for
anything
about
entail
how
anyone
could
conscience
to
entail
away
an
estate
from
one
s
own
daughters
cannot
understand
for
sake
mr
collins
too
why
he
more
than
anybody
else
leave
to
yourself
to
determine
said
mr
bennet
chapter
miss
bingley
s
letter
arrived
put
an
end
to
doubt
very
first
sentence
conveyed
assurance
their
being
settled
in
london
for
winter
concluded
with
her
brother
s
regret
at
not
having
had
time
to
pay
his
respects
to
his
friends
in
hertfordshire
before
he
left
country
hope
was
over
entirely
over
when
jane
could
attend
to
rest
letter
she
found
little
except
professed
affection
writer
that
could
give
her
any
comfort
miss
darcy
s
praise

her
many
attractions
were
again
dwelt
on
caroline
boasted
joyfully
their
increasing
intimacy
ventured
to
predict
accomplishment
wishes
which
had
been
unfolded
in
her
former
letter
she
wrote
also
with
great
pleasure
her
brother
s
being
an
inmate
mr
darcy
s
house
mentioned
with
raptures
some
plans
latter
with
regard
to
new
furniture
elizabeth
to
whom
jane
very
soon
communicated
chief
heard
in
silent
indignation
her
heart
was
divided
between
concern
for
her
sister
resentment
against
others
to
caroline
s
assertion
her
brother
s
being
partial
to
miss
darcy
she
paid
no
credit
that
he
was
really
fond
jane
she
doubted
no
more
than
she
had
ever
done
much
as
she
had
always
been
disposed
to
like
him
she
could
not
think
without
anger
hardly
without
contempt
on
that
easiness
temper
that
want
proper
resolution
which
now
made
him
slave
his
designing
friends
led
him
to
sacrifice
his
own
happiness
to
caprice
their
inclination
had
his
own
happiness
however
been
only
sacrifice
he
might
been
allowed
to
sport
with
in
whatever
manner
he
thought
best
but
her
sister
s
was
involved
in
as
she
thought
he
must
be
sensible
himself
was
subject
in
short
on
which
reflection
would
be
long
indulged
must
be
unavailing
she
could
think
nothing
else
yet
whether
bingley
s
regard
had
really
died
away
or
were
suppressed
by
his
friends
interference
whether
he
had
been
aware
jane
s
attachment
or
whether
had
escaped
his
observation
whatever
were
case
though
her
opinion
him
must
be
materially
affected
by
difference
her
sister
s
situation
remained
same
her
peace
equally
wounded
day
or
two
passed
before
jane
had
courage
to
speak
her
feelings
to
elizabeth
but
at
last
on
mrs
bennet
s
leaving
them
together
after
longer
irritation
than
usual
about
netherfield
its
master
she
could
not
help
saying
oh
that
my
dear
mother
had
more
command
over
herself
she
can
no
idea
pain
she
gives
me
by
her
continual
reflections
on
him
but
will
not
repine
cannot
last
long
he
will
be
forgot
we
shall
be
as
we
were
before
elizabeth
looked
at
her
sister
with
incredulous
solicitude
but
said
nothing
you
doubt
me
cried
jane
slightly
colouring
indeed
you
no
reason
he
may
live
in
my
memory
as
most
amiable
man
my
acquaintance
but
that
nothing
either
to
hope
or
fear
nothing
to
reproach
him
with
thank
god
not
that
pain
little
time
therefore
shall
certainly
try
to
get
better
with
stronger
voice
she
soon
added
comfort
immediately
that
has
not
been
more
than
an
error
fancy
on
my
side
that
has
done
no
harm
to
anyone
but
myself
my
dear
jane
exclaimed
elizabeth
you
too
good
your
sweetness
disinterestedness
really
angelic
do
not
know
what
to
say
to
you
feel
as
if
had
never
done
you
justice
or
loved
you
as
you

met
with
two
instances
lately
one

charlotte

marriage
unaccountable
in
every
view
unaccountable
my
dear
lizzy
do
not
give
way
to
such
feelings
as
these
they
will
ruin
your
happiness
you
do
not
make
allowance
enough
for
difference
situation
temper
consider
mr
collins
s
respectability
charlotte
s
steady
prudent
character
remember
that
she
one
large
family
that
as
to
fortune
most
eligible
match
be
ready
to
believe
for
everybody
s
sake
that
she
may
feel
something
like
regard
esteem
for
our
cousin
to
oblige
you
would
try
to
believe
almost
anything
but
no
one
else
could
be
benefited
by
such
belief
as
for
were
persuaded
that
charlotte
had
any
regard
for
him
only
think
worse
her
understanding
than
now
do
her
heart
my
dear
jane
mr
collins
conceited
pompous
narrow
minded
silly
man
you
know
he
as
well
as
do
you
must
feel
as
well
as
do
that
woman
who
married
him
cannot
proper
way
thinking
you
shall
not
defend
her
though
charlotte
lucas
you
shall
not
for
sake
one
individual
change
meaning
principle
integrity
nor
endeavour
to
persuade
yourself
or
me
that
selfishness
prudence
insensibility
danger
security
for
happiness
must
think
your
language
too
strong
in
speaking
both
replied
jane
hope
you
will
be
convinced
by
seeing
them
happy
together
but
enough
you
alluded
to
something
else
you
mentioned
two
instances
cannot
misunderstand
you
but
entreat
you
dear
lizzy
not
to
pain
me
by
thinking
that
person
to
blame
saying
your
opinion
him
sunk
we
must
not
be
so
ready
to
fancy
ourselves
intentionally
injured
we
must
not
expect
lively
young
man
to
be
always
so
guarded
circumspect
very
often
nothing
but
our
own
vanity
that
deceives
us
women
fancy
admiration
means
more
than
does
men
take
care
that
they
if
designedly
done
they
cannot
be
justified
but
no
idea
there
being
so
much
design
in
world
as
some
persons
imagine
far
from
attributing
any
part
mr
bingley
s
conduct
to
design
said
elizabeth
but
without
scheming
to
do
wrong
or
to
make
others
unhappy
there
may
be
error
there
may
be
misery
thoughtlessness
want
attention
to
other
people
s
feelings
want
resolution
will
do
business
do
you
impute
to
either
those
yes
to
last
but
if
go
on
shall
displease
you
by
saying
what
think
persons
you
esteem
stop
me
whilst
you
can
you
persist
then
in
supposing
his
sisters
influence
him
yes
in
conjunction
with
his
friend
cannot
believe
why
they
try
to
influence
him
they
can
only
wish
his
happiness
if
he
attached
to
me
no
other
woman
can
secure
your
first
position
false
they
may
wish
many
things
besides
his
happiness
they
may
wish
his
increase
wealth
consequence
they
may
wish
him
to
marry
girl
who
has
importance
money
great
connections
pride
beyond
doubt
they
do
wish
him
to
choose
miss
darcy
replied
jane
but
may
be
from
better
feelings
than
you
supposing
they
known
her
much
longer
than
they
known
me
no
wonder
if
they
love
her
better
but
whatever
may
be
their
own
wishes
very
unlikely
they
opposed
their
brother
s
what
sister
would
think
herself
at
liberty
to
do
unless
there
were
something
very
objectionable
if
they
believed
him
attached
to
me
they
would
not
try
to
part
us
if
he
were
so
they
could
not
succeed
by
supposing
such
an
affection
you
make
everybody
acting
unnaturally
wrong
me
most
unhappy
do
not
distress
me
by
idea
not
ashamed
having
been
mistaken
or
at
least
light
nothing
in
comparison
what
feel
in
thinking
ill
him
or
his
sisters
let
me
take
in
best
light
in
light
in
which
may
be
understood
elizabeth
could
not
oppose
such
wish
from
time
mr
bingley
s
name
was
scarcely
ever
mentioned
between
them
mrs
bennet
still
continued
to
wonder
repine
at
his
returning
no
more
though
day
seldom
passed
in
which
elizabeth
did
not
account
for
clearly
there
was
little
chance
her
ever
considering
with
less
perplexity
her
daughter
endeavoured
to
convince
her
what
she
did
not
believe
herself
that
his
attentions
to
jane
had
been
merely
effect
common
transient
liking
which
ceased
when
he
saw
her
no
more
but
though
probability
statement
was
admitted
at
time
she
had
same
story
to
repeat
every
day
mrs
bennet
s
best
comfort
was
that
mr
bingley
must
be
down
again
in
summer
mr
bennet
treated
matter
differently
so
lizzy
said
he
one
day
your
sister
crossed
in
love
find
congratulate
her
next
to
being
married
girl
likes
to
be
crossed
little
in
love
now
then
something
to
think
gives
her
sort
distinction
among
her
companions
when
your
turn
to
come
you
will
hardly
bear
to
be
long
outdone
by
jane
now
your
time
here
officers
enough
in
meryton
to
disappoint
young
ladies
in
country
let
wickham
be
your
man
he
pleasant
fellow
would
jilt
you
creditably
thank
you
sir
but
less
agreeable
man
would
satisfy
me
we
must
not
expect
jane
s
good
fortune
true
said
mr
bennet
but
comfort
to
think
that
whatever
that
kind
may
befall
you
you
an
affectionate
mother
who
will
make
most
mr
wickham
s
society
was
material
service
in
dispelling
gloom
which
late
perverse
occurrences
had
thrown
on
many
longbourn
family
they
saw
him
often
to
his
other
recommendations
was
now
added
that
general
unreserve
whole
what
elizabeth
had
already
heard
his
claims
on
mr
darcy
that
he
had
suffered
from
him
was
now
openly
acknowledged
publicly
canvassed
everybody
was
pleased
to
know
how
much
they
had
always
disliked
mr
darcy
before
they
had
known
anything
matter
miss
bennet
was
only
creature
who
could
suppose
there
might
be
any
extenuating
circumstances
in
case
unknown
to
society
hertfordshire
her
mild
steady
candour
always
pleaded
for
allowances
urged
possibility
mistakes
but
by
everybody
else
mr
darcy
was
condemned
as
worst
men
chapter
after
week
spent
in
professions
love
schemes
felicity
mr
collins
was
called
from
his
amiable
charlotte
by
arrival
saturday
pain
separation
however
might
be
alleviated
on
his
side
by
preparations
for
reception
his
bride
as
he
had
reason
to
hope
that
shortly
after
his
return
into
hertfordshire
day
would
be
fixed
that
was
to
make
him
happiest
men
he
took
leave
his
relations
at
longbourn
with
as
much
solemnity
as
before
wished
his
fair
cousins
health
happiness
again
promised
their
father
another
letter
thanks
on
following
monday
mrs
bennet
had
pleasure
receiving
her
brother
his
wife
who
came
as
usual
to
spend
christmas
at
longbourn
mr
gardiner
was
sensible
gentlemanlike
man
greatly
superior
to
his
sister
as
well
by
nature
as
education
netherfield
ladies
would
had
difficulty
in
believing
that
man
who
lived
by
trade
within
view
his
own
warehouses
could
been
so
well
bred
agreeable
mrs
gardiner
who
was
several
years
younger
than
mrs
bennet
mrs
phillips
was
an
amiable
intelligent
elegant
woman
great
favourite
with
her
longbourn
nieces
between
two
eldest
herself
especially
there
subsisted
particular
regard
they
had
frequently
been
staying
with
her
in
town
first
part
mrs
gardiner
s
business
on
her
arrival
was
to
distribute
her
presents
describe
newest
fashions
when
was
done
she
had
less
active
part
to
play
became
her
turn
to
listen
mrs
bennet
had
many
grievances
to
relate
much
to
complain
they
had
been
very
ill
used
since
she
last
saw
her
sister
two
her
girls
had
been
upon
point
marriage
after
there
was
nothing
in
do
not
blame
jane
she
continued
for
jane
would
got
mr
bingley
if
she
could
but
lizzy
oh
sister
very
hard
to
think
that
she
might
been
mr
collins
s
wife
by
time
had
not
been
for
her
own
perverseness
he
made
her
an
offer
in
very
room
she
refused
him
consequence
that
lady
lucas
will
daughter
married
before
that
longbourn
estate
just
as
much
entailed
as
ever
lucases
very
artful
people
indeed
sister
they
for
what
they
can
get
sorry
to
say
them
but
so
makes
me
very
nervous
poorly
to
be
thwarted
so
in
my
own
family
to
neighbours
who
think
themselves
before
anybody
else
however
your
coming
just
at
time
greatest
comforts
very
glad
to
hear
what
you
tell
us
long
sleeves
mrs
gardiner
to
whom
chief
news
had
been
given
before
in
course
jane
elizabeth
s
correspondence
with
her
made
her
sister
slight
answer
in
compassion
to
her
nieces
turned
conversation
when
alone
with
elizabeth
afterwards
she
spoke
more
on
subject
seems
likely
to
been
desirable
match
for
jane
said
she
sorry
went
off
but
these
things
happen
so
often
young
man
such
as
you
describe
mr
bingley
so
easily
falls
in
love
with
pretty
girl
for
few
weeks
when
accident
separates
them
so
easily
forgets
her
that
these
sort
inconsistencies
very
frequent
an
excellent
consolation
in
its
way
said
elizabeth
but
will
not
do
for
us
we
do
not
suffer
by
accident
does
not
often
happen
that
interference
friends
will
persuade
young
man
independent
fortune
to
think
no
more
girl
whom
he
was
violently
in
love
with
only
few
days
before
but
that
expression
violently
in
love
so
hackneyed
so
doubtful
so
indefinite
that
gives
me
very
little
idea
as
often
applied
to
feelings
which
arise
from
half
hour
s
acquaintance
as
to
real
strong
attachment
pray
how
violent
was
mr
bingley
s
love
never
saw
more
promising
inclination
he
was
growing
quite
inattentive
to
other
people
wholly
engrossed
by
her
every
time
they
met
was
more
decided
remarkable
at
his
own
ball
he
offended
two
or
young
ladies
by
not
asking
them
to
dance
spoke
to
him
twice
myself
without
receiving
an
answer
could
there
be
finer
symptoms
not
general
incivility
very
essence
love
oh
yes
that
kind
love
which
suppose
him
to
felt
poor
jane
sorry
for
her
because
with
her
disposition
she
may
not
get
over
immediately
had
better
happened
to
you
lizzy
you
would
laughed
yourself
out
sooner
but
do
you
think
she
would
be
prevailed
upon
to
go
back
with
us
change
scene
might
be
service
perhaps
little
relief
from
home
may
be
as
useful
as
anything
elizabeth
was
exceedingly
pleased
with
proposal
felt
persuaded
her
sister
s
ready
acquiescence
hope
added
mrs
gardiner
that
no
consideration
with
regard
to
young
man
will
influence
her
we
live
in
so
different
part
town
our
connections
so
different
as
you
well
know
we
go
out
so
little
that
very
improbable
that
they
meet
at
unless
he
really
comes
to
see
her
that
quite
impossible
for
he
now
in
custody
his
friend
mr
darcy
would
no
more
suffer
him
to
call
on
jane
in
such
part
london
my
dear
aunt
how
could
you
think
mr
darcy
may
perhaps
heard
such
place
as
gracechurch
street
but
he
would
hardly
think
month
s
ablution
enough
to
cleanse
him
from
its
impurities
were
he
once
to
enter
depend
upon
mr
bingley
never
stirs
without
him
so
much
better
hope
they
will
not
meet
at
but
does
not
jane
correspond
with
his
sister
she
will
not
be
able
to
help
calling
she
will
drop
acquaintance
entirely
but
in
spite
certainty
in
which
elizabeth
affected
to
place
point
as
well
as
still
more
interesting
one
bingley
s
being
withheld
from
seeing
jane
she
felt
solicitude
on
subject
which
convinced
her
on
examination
that
she
did
not
consider
entirely
hopeless
was
possible
sometimes
she
thought
probable
that
his
affection
might
be
reanimated
influence
his
friends
successfully
combated
by
more
natural
influence
jane
s
attractions
miss
bennet
accepted
her
aunt
s
invitation
with
pleasure
bingleys
were
no
otherwise
in
her
thoughts
at
same
time
than
as
she
hoped
by
caroline
s
not
living
in
same
house
with
her
brother
she
might
occasionally
spend
morning
with
her
without
any
danger
seeing
him
gardiners
stayed
week
at
longbourn
what
with
phillipses
lucases
officers
there
was
not
day
without
its
engagement
mrs
bennet
had
so
carefully
provided
for
entertainment
her
brother
sister
that
they
did
not
once
sit
down
to
family
dinner
when
engagement
was
for
home
some
officers
always
made
part
which
officers
mr
wickham
was
sure
to
be
one
on
these
occasion
mrs
gardiner
rendered
suspicious
by
elizabeth
s
warm
commendation
narrowly
observed
them
both
without
supposing
them
from
what
she
saw
to
be
very
seriously
in
love
their
preference
each
other
was
plain
enough
to
make
her
little
uneasy
she
resolved
to
speak
to
elizabeth
on
subject
before
she
left
hertfordshire
represent
to
her
imprudence
encouraging
such
an
attachment
to
mrs
gardiner
wickham
had
one
means
affording
pleasure
unconnected
with
his
general
powers
about
ten
or
dozen
years
ago
before
her
marriage
she
had
spent
considerable
time
in
that
very
part
derbyshire
to
which
he
belonged
they
had
therefore
many
acquaintances
in
common
though
wickham
had
been
little
there
since
death
darcy
s
father
was
yet
in
his
power
to
give
her
fresher
intelligence
her
former
friends
than
she
had
been
in
way
procuring
mrs
gardiner
had
seen
pemberley
known
late
mr
darcy
by
character
perfectly
well
here
consequently
was
an
inexhaustible
subject
discourse
in
comparing
her
recollection
pemberley
with
minute
description
which
wickham
could
give
in
bestowing
her
tribute
praise
on
character
its
late
possessor
she
was
delighting
both
him
herself
on
being
made
acquainted
with
present
mr
darcy
s
treatment
him
she
tried
to
remember
some
that
gentleman
s
reputed
disposition
when
quite
lad
which
might
agree
with
was
confident
at
last
that
she
recollected
having
heard
mr
fitzwilliam
darcy
formerly
spoken
as
very
proud
ill
natured
boy
chapter
mrs
gardiner
s
caution
to
elizabeth
was
punctually
kindly
given
on
first
favourable
opportunity
speaking
to
her
alone
after
honestly
telling
her
what
she
thought
she
thus
went
on
you
too
sensible
girl
lizzy
to
fall
in
love
merely
because
you
warned
against
therefore
not
afraid
speaking
openly
seriously
would
you
be
on
your
guard
do
not
involve
yourself
or
endeavour
to
involve
him
in
an
affection
which
want
fortune
would
make
so
very
imprudent
nothing
to
say
against
him
he
most
interesting
young
man
if
he
had
fortune
he
ought
to
think
you
could
not
do
better
but
as
you
must
not
let
your
fancy
run
away
with
you
you
sense
we
expect
you
to
use
your
father
would
depend
on
your
resolution
good
conduct
sure
you
must
not
disappoint
your
father
my
dear
aunt
being
serious
indeed
yes
hope
to
engage
you
to
be
serious
likewise
well
then
you
need
not
be
under
any
alarm
will
take
care
myself
mr
wickham
too
he
shall
not
be
in
love
with
me
if
can
prevent
elizabeth
you
not
serious
now
beg
your
pardon
will
try
again
at
present
not
in
love
with
mr
wickham
no
certainly
not
but
he
beyond
comparison
most
agreeable
man
ever
saw
if
he
becomes
really
attached
to
me
believe
will
be
better
that
he
not
see
imprudence
oh
that
abominable
mr
darcy
my
father
s
opinion
me
does
me
greatest
honour
be
miserable
to
forfeit
my
father
however
partial
to
mr
wickham
in
short
my
dear
aunt
be
very
sorry
to
be
means
making
any
you
unhappy
but
since
we
see
every
day
that
where
there
affection
young
people
seldom
withheld
by
immediate
want
fortune
from
entering
into
engagements
with
each
other
how
can
promise
to
be
wiser
than
so
many
my
fellow
creatures
if
tempted
or
how
even
to
know
that
would
be
wisdom
to
resist
that
can
promise
you
therefore
not
to
be
in
hurry
will
not
be
in
hurry
to
believe
myself
his
first
object
when
in
company
with
him
will
not
be
wishing
in
short
will
do
my
best
perhaps
will
be
as
well
if
you
discourage
his
coming
here
so
very
often
at
least
you
not
remind
your
mother
inviting
him
as
did
other
day
said
elizabeth
with
conscious
smile
very
true
will
be
wise
in
me
to
refrain
from
that
but
do
not
imagine
that
he
always
here
so
often
on
your
account
that
he
has
been
so
frequently
invited
week
you
know
my
mother
s
ideas
as
to
necessity
constant
company
for
her
friends
but
really
upon
my
honour
will
try
to
do
what
think
to
be
wisest
now
hope
you
satisfied
her
aunt
assured
her
that
she
was
elizabeth
having
thanked
her
for
kindness
her
hints
they
parted
wonderful
instance
advice
being
given
on
such
point
without
being
resented
mr
collins
returned
into
hertfordshire
soon
after
had
been
quitted
by
gardiners
jane
but
as
he
took
up
his
abode
with
lucases
his
arrival
was
no
great
inconvenience
to
mrs
bennet
his
marriage
was
now
fast
approaching
she
was
at
length
so
far
resigned
as
to
think
inevitable
even
repeatedly
to
say
in
an
ill
natured
tone
that
she
wished
they
might
be
happy
thursday
was
to
be
wedding
day
on
wednesday
miss
lucas
paid
her
farewell
visit
when
she
rose
to
take
leave
elizabeth
ashamed
her
mother
s
ungracious
reluctant
good
wishes
sincerely
affected
herself
accompanied
her
out
room
as
they
went
downstairs
together
charlotte
said
shall
depend
on
hearing
from
you
very
often
eliza
that
you
certainly
shall
another
favour
to
ask
you
will
you
come
see
me
we
shall
often
meet
hope
in
hertfordshire
not
likely
to
leave
kent
for
some
time
promise
me
therefore
to
come
to
hunsford
elizabeth
could
not
refuse
though
she
foresaw
little
pleasure
in
visit
my
father
maria
coming
to
me
in
march
added
charlotte
hope
you
will
consent
to
be
party
indeed
eliza
you
will
be
as
welcome
as
either
them
wedding
took
place
bride
bridegroom
set
off
for
kent
from
church
door
everybody
had
as
much
to
say
or
to
hear
on
subject
as
usual
elizabeth
soon
heard
from
her
friend
their
correspondence
was
as
regular
frequent
as
had
ever
been
that
be
equally
unreserved
was
impossible
elizabeth
could
never
address
her
without
feeling
that
comfort
intimacy
was
over
though
determined
not
to
slacken
as
correspondent
was
for
sake
what
had
been
rather
than
what
was
charlotte
s
first
letters
were
received
with
good
deal
eagerness
there
could
not
but
be
curiosity
to
know
how
she
would
speak
her
new
home
how
she
would
like
lady
catherine
how
happy
she
would
dare
pronounce
herself
to
be
though
when
letters
were
read
elizabeth
felt
that
charlotte
expressed
herself
on
every
point
exactly
as
she
might
foreseen
she
wrote
cheerfully
seemed
surrounded
with
comforts
mentioned
nothing
which
she
could
not
praise
house
furniture
neighbourhood
roads
were
to
her
taste
lady
catherine
s
behaviour
was
most
friendly
obliging
was
mr
collins
s
picture
hunsford
rosings
rationally
softened
elizabeth
perceived
that
she
must
wait
for
her
own
visit
there
to
know
rest
jane
had
already
written
few
lines
to
her
sister
to
announce
their
safe
arrival
in
london
when
she
wrote
again
elizabeth
hoped
would
be
in
her
power
to
say
something
bingleys
her
impatience
for
letter
was
as
well
rewarded
as
impatience
generally
jane
had
been
week
in
town
without
either
seeing
or
hearing
from
caroline
she
accounted
for
however
by
supposing
that
her
last
letter
to
her
friend
from
longbourn
had
by
some
accident
been
lost
my
aunt
she
continued
going
to
morrow
into
that
part
town
shall
take
opportunity
calling
in
grosvenor
street
she
wrote
again
when
visit
was
paid
she
had
seen
miss
bingley
did
not
think
caroline
in
spirits
were
her
words
but
she
was
very
glad
to
see
me
reproached
me
for
giving
her
no
notice
my
coming
to
london
was
right
therefore
my
last
letter
had
never
reached
her
inquired
after
their
brother
course
he
was
well
but
so
much
engaged
with
mr
darcy
that
they
scarcely
ever
saw
him
found
that
miss
darcy
was
expected
to
dinner
wish
could
see
her
my
visit
was
not
long
as
caroline
mrs
hurst
were
going
out
dare
say
shall
see
them
soon
here
elizabeth
shook
her
head
over
letter
convinced
her
that
accident
only
could
discover
to
mr
bingley
her
sister
s
being
in
town
four
weeks
passed
away
jane
saw
nothing
him
she
endeavoured
to
persuade
herself
that
she
did
not
regret
but
she
could
no
longer
be
blind
to
miss
bingley
s
inattention
after
waiting
at
home
every
morning
for
fortnight
inventing
every
evening
fresh
excuse
for
her
visitor
did
at
last
appear
but
shortness
her
stay
yet
more
alteration
her
manner
would
allow
jane
to
deceive
herself
no
longer
letter
which
she
wrote
on
occasion
to
her
sister
will
prove
what
she
felt
my
dearest
lizzy
will
sure
be
incapable
triumphing
in
her
better
judgement
at
my
expense
when
confess
myself
to
been
entirely
deceived
in
miss
bingley
s
regard
for
me
but
my
dear
sister
though
event
has
proved
you
right
do
not
think
me
obstinate
if
still
assert
that
considering
what
her
behaviour
was
my
confidence
was
as
natural
as
your
suspicion
do
not
at
comprehend
her
reason
for
wishing
to
be
intimate
with
me
but
if
same
circumstances
were
to
happen
again
sure
be
deceived
again
caroline
did
not
return
my
visit
till
yesterday
not
note
not
line
did
receive
in
meantime
when
she
did
come
was
very
evident
that
she
had
no
pleasure
in
she
made
slight
formal
apology
for
not
calling
before
said
not
word
wishing
to
see
me
again
was
in
every
respect
so
altered
creature
that
when
she
went
away
was
perfectly
resolved
to
continue
acquaintance
no
longer
pity
though
cannot
help
blaming
her
she
was
very
wrong
in
singling
me
out
as
she
did
can
safely
say
that
every
advance
to
intimacy
began
on
her
side
but
pity
her
because
she
must
feel
that
she
has
been
acting
wrong
because
very
sure
that
anxiety
for
her
brother
cause
need
not
explain
myself
farther
though
we
know
anxiety
to
be
quite
needless
yet
if
she
feels
will
easily
account
for
her
behaviour
to
me
so
deservedly
dear
as
he
to
his
sister
whatever
anxiety
she
must
feel
on
his
behalf
natural
amiable
cannot
but
wonder
however
at
her
having
any
such
fears
now
because
if
he
had
at
cared
about
me
we
must
met
long
ago
he
knows
my
being
in
town
certain
from
something
she
said
herself
yet
would
seem
by
her
manner
talking
as
if
she
wanted
to
persuade
herself
that
he
really
partial
to
miss
darcy
cannot
understand
if
were
not
afraid
judging
harshly
be
almost
tempted
to
say
that
there
strong
appearance
duplicity
in
but
will
endeavour
to
banish
every
painful
thought
think
only
what
will
make
me
happy
your
affection
invariable
kindness
my
dear
uncle
aunt
let
me
hear
from
you
very
soon
miss
bingley
said
something
his
never
returning
to
netherfield
again
giving
up
house
but
not
with
any
certainty
we
had
better
not
mention
extremely
glad
that
you
such
pleasant
accounts
from
our
friends
at
hunsford
pray
go
to
see
them
with
sir
william
maria
sure
you
will
be
very
comfortable
there
yours
etc
letter
gave
elizabeth
some
pain
but
her
spirits
returned
as
she
considered
that
jane
would
no
longer
be
duped
by
sister
at
least
expectation
from
brother
was
now
absolutely
over
she
would
not
even
wish
for
renewal
his
attentions
his
character
sunk
on
every
review
as
punishment
for
him
as
well
as
possible
advantage
to
jane
she
seriously
hoped
he
might
really
soon
marry
mr
darcy
s
sister
as
by
wickham
s
account
she
would
make
him
abundantly
regret
what
he
had
thrown
away
mrs
gardiner
about
time
reminded
elizabeth
her
promise
concerning
that
gentleman
required
information
elizabeth
had
such
to
send
as
might
rather
give
contentment
to
her
aunt
than
to
herself
his
apparent
partiality
had
subsided
his
attentions
were
over
he
was
admirer
some
one
else
elizabeth
was
watchful
enough
to
see
but
she
could
see
write
without
material
pain
her
heart
had
been
but
slightly
touched
her
vanity
was
satisfied
with
believing
that
she
would
been
his
only
choice
had
fortune
permitted
sudden
acquisition
ten
thousand
pounds
was
most
remarkable
charm
young
lady
to
whom
he
was
now
rendering
himself
agreeable
but
elizabeth
less
clear
sighted
perhaps
in
case
than
in
charlotte
s
did
not
quarrel
with
him
for
his
wish
independence
nothing
on
contrary
could
be
more
natural
while
able
to
suppose
that
cost
him
few
struggles
to
relinquish
her
she
was
ready
to
allow
wise
desirable
measure
for
both
could
very
sincerely
wish
him
happy
was
acknowledged
to
mrs
gardiner
after
relating
circumstances
she
thus
went
on
now
convinced
my
dear
aunt
that
never
been
much
in
love
for
had
really
experienced
that
pure
elevating
passion
at
present
detest
his
very
name
wish
him
manner
evil
but
my
feelings
not
only
cordial
towards
him
they
even
impartial
towards
miss
king
cannot
find
out
that
hate
her
at
or
that
in
least
unwilling
to
think
her
very
good
sort
girl
there
can
be
no
love
in
my
watchfulness
has
been
effectual
though
certainly
be
more
interesting
object
to
my
acquaintances
were
distractedly
in
love
with
him
cannot
say
that
regret
my
comparative
insignificance
importance
may
sometimes
be
purchased
too
dearly
kitty
lydia
take
his
defection
much
more
to
heart
than
do
they
young
in
ways
world
not
yet
open
to
mortifying
conviction
that
handsome
young
men
must

live
on

well
as

with
no
greater
events
than
these

diversified
by

beyond
walks

dirty
sometimes
cold
did
january
february
pass
away
march
was
to
take
elizabeth
to
hunsford
she
had
not
at
first
thought
very
seriously
going
thither
but
charlotte
she
soon
found
was
depending
on
plan
she
gradually
learned
to
consider
herself
with
greater
pleasure
as
well
as
greater
certainty
absence
had
increased
her
desire
seeing
charlotte
again
weakened
her
disgust
mr
collins
there
was
novelty
in
scheme
as
with
such
mother
such
uncompanionable
sisters
home
could
not
be
faultless
little
change
was
not
unwelcome
for
its
own
sake
journey
would
moreover
give
her
peep
at
jane
in
short
as
time
drew
near
she
would
been
very
sorry
for
any
delay
everything
however
went
on
smoothly
was
finally
settled
according
to
charlotte
s
first
sketch
she
was
to
accompany
sir
william
his
daughter
improvement
spending
night
in
london
was
added
in
time
plan
became
perfect
as
plan
could
be
only
pain
was
in
leaving
her
father
who
would
certainly
miss
her
who
when
came
to
point
so
little
liked
her
going
that
he
told
her
to
write
to
him
almost
promised
to
answer
her
letter
farewell
between
herself
mr
wickham
was
perfectly
friendly
on
his
side
even
more
his
present
pursuit
could
not
make
him
forget
that
elizabeth
had
been
first
to
excite
to
deserve
his
attention
first
to
listen
to
pity
first
to
be
admired
in
his
manner
bidding
her
adieu
wishing
her
every
enjoyment
reminding
her
what
she
was
to
expect
in
lady
catherine
de
bourgh
trusting
their
opinion
her
their
opinion
everybody
would
always
coincide
there
was
solicitude
an
interest
which
she
felt
must
ever
attach
her
to
him
with
most
sincere
regard
she
parted
from
him
convinced
that
whether
married
or
single
he
must
always
be
her
model
amiable
pleasing
her
fellow
travellers
next
day
were
not
kind
to
make
her
think
him
less
agreeable
sir
william
lucas
his
daughter
maria
good
humoured
girl
but
as
empty
headed
as
himself
had
nothing
to
say
that
could
be
worth
hearing
were
listened
to
with
about
as
much
delight
as
rattle
chaise
elizabeth
loved
absurdities
but
she
had
known
sir
william
s
too
long
he
could
tell
her
nothing
new
wonders
his
presentation
knighthood
his
civilities
were
worn
out
like
his
information
was
journey
only
twenty
four
miles
they
began
so
early
as
to
be
in
gracechurch
street
by
noon
as
they
drove
to
mr
gardiner
s
door
jane
was
at
drawing
room
window
watching
their
arrival
when
they
entered
passage
she
was
there
to
welcome
them
elizabeth
looking
earnestly
in
her
face
was
pleased
to
see
healthful
lovely
as
ever
on
stairs
were
troop
little
boys
girls
whose
eagerness
for
their
cousin
s
appearance
would
not
allow
them
to
wait
in
drawing
room
whose
shyness
as
they
had
not
seen
her
for
twelvemonth
prevented
their
coming
lower
was
joy
kindness
day
passed
most
pleasantly
away
morning
in
bustle
shopping
evening
at
one
theatres
elizabeth
then
contrived
to
sit
by
her
aunt
their
first
object
was
her
sister
she
was
more
grieved
than
astonished
to
hear
in
reply
to
her
minute
inquiries
that
though
jane
always
struggled
to
support
her
spirits
there
were
periods
dejection
was
reasonable
however
to
hope
that
they
would
not
continue
long
mrs
gardiner
gave
her
particulars
also
miss
bingley
s
visit
in
gracechurch
street
repeated
conversations
occurring
at
different
times
between
jane
herself
which
proved
that
former
had
from
her
heart
given
up
acquaintance
mrs
gardiner
then
rallied
her
niece
on
wickham
s
desertion
complimented
her
on
bearing
so
well
but
my
dear
elizabeth
she
added
what
sort
girl
miss
king
be
sorry
to
think
our
friend
mercenary
pray
my
dear
aunt
what
difference
in
matrimonial
affairs
between
mercenary
prudent
motive
where
does
discretion
end
avarice
begin
last
christmas
you
were
afraid
his
marrying
me
because
would
be
imprudent
now
because
he
trying
to
get
girl
with
only
ten
thousand
pounds
you
want
to
find
out
that
he
mercenary
if
you
will
only
tell
me
what
sort
girl
miss
king
shall
know
what
to
think
she
very
good
kind
girl
believe
know
no
harm
her
but
he
paid
her
not
smallest
attention
till
her
grandfather
s
death
made
her
mistress
fortune
no
what
he
if
were
not
allowable
for
him
to
gain
my
affections
because
had
no
money
what
occasion
could
there
be
for
making
love
to
girl
whom
he
did
not
care
about
who
was
equally
poor
but
there
seems
an
indelicacy
in
directing
his
attentions
towards
her
so
soon
after
event
man
in
distressed
circumstances
has
not
time
for
those
elegant
decorums
which
other
people
may
observe
if
she
does
not
object
to
why
we
her
not
objecting
does
not
justify
him
only
shows
her
being
deficient
in
something
herself
sense
or
feeling
well
cried
elizabeth
as
you
choose
he
shall
be
mercenary
she
shall
be
foolish
no
lizzy
that
what
do
not
choose
be
sorry
you
know
to
think
ill
young
man
who
has
lived
so
long
in
derbyshire
oh
if
that
very
poor
opinion
young
men
who
live
in
derbyshire
their
intimate
friends
who
live
in
hertfordshire
not
much
better
sick
them
thank
heaven
going
to
morrow
where
shall
find
man
who
has
not
one
agreeable
quality
who
has
neither
manner
nor
sense
to
recommend
him
stupid
men
only
ones
worth
knowing
after
take
care
lizzy
that
speech
savours
strongly
disappointment
before
they
were
separated
by
conclusion
play
she
had
unexpected
happiness
an
invitation
to
accompany
her
uncle
aunt
in
tour
pleasure
which
they
proposed
taking
in
summer
we
not
determined
how
far
shall
carry
us
said
mrs
gardiner
but
perhaps
to
lakes
no
scheme
could
been
more
agreeable
to
elizabeth
her
acceptance
invitation
was
most
ready
grateful
oh
my
dear
dear
aunt
she
rapturously
cried
what
delight
what
felicity
you
give
me
fresh
life
vigour
adieu
to
disappointment
spleen
what
young
men
to
rocks
mountains
oh
what
hours
transport
we
shall
spend
when
we
do
return
shall
not
be
like
other
travellers
without
being
able
to
give
one
accurate
idea
anything
we
will
know
where
we
gone
we
will
recollect
what
we
seen
lakes
mountains
rivers
shall
not
be
jumbled
together
in
our
imaginations
nor
when
we
attempt
to
describe
any
particular
scene
will
we
begin
quarreling
about
its
relative
situation
let
our
first
effusions
be
less
insupportable
than
those
generality
travellers
chapter
every
object
in
next
day
s
journey
was
new
interesting
to
elizabeth
her
spirits
were
in
state
enjoyment
for
she
had
seen
her
sister
looking
so
well
as
to
banish
fear
for
her
health
prospect
her
northern
tour
was
constant
source
delight
when
they
left
high
road
for
lane
to
hunsford
every
eye
was
in
search
parsonage
every
turning
expected
to
bring
in
view
palings
rosings
park
was
their
boundary
on
one
side
elizabeth
smiled
at
recollection
that
she
had
heard
its
inhabitants
at
length
parsonage
was
discernible
garden
sloping
to
road
house
standing
in
green
pales
laurel
hedge
everything
declared
they
were
arriving
mr
collins
charlotte
appeared
at
door
carriage
stopped
at
small
gate
which
led
by
short
gravel
walk
to
house
amidst
nods
smiles
whole
party
in
moment
they
were
out
chaise
rejoicing
at
sight
each
other
mrs
collins
welcomed
her
friend
with
liveliest
pleasure
elizabeth
was
more
more
satisfied
with
coming
when
she
found
herself
so
affectionately
received
she
saw
instantly
that
her
cousin
s
manners
were
not
altered
by
his
marriage
his
formal
civility
was
just
what
had
been
he
detained
her
some
minutes
at
gate
to
hear
satisfy
his
inquiries
after
her
family
they
were
then
with
no
other
delay
than
his
pointing
out
neatness
entrance
taken
into
house
as
soon
as
they
were
in
parlour
he
welcomed
them
time
with
ostentatious
formality
to
his
humble
abode
punctually
repeated
his
wife
s
offers
refreshment
elizabeth
was
prepared
to
see
him
in
his
glory
she
could
not
help
in
fancying
that
in
displaying
good
proportion
room
its
aspect
its
furniture
he
addressed
himself
particularly
to
her
as
if
wishing
to
make
her
feel
what
she
had
lost
in
refusing
him
but
though
everything
seemed
neat
comfortable
she
was
not
able
to
gratify
him
by
any
sigh
repentance
rather
looked
with
wonder
at
her
friend
that
she
could
so
cheerful
an
air
with
such
companion
when
mr
collins
said
anything
which
his
wife
might
reasonably
be
ashamed
which
certainly
was
not
unseldom
she
involuntarily
turned
her
eye
on
charlotte
once
or
twice
she
could
discern
faint
blush
but
in
general
charlotte
wisely
did
not
hear
after
sitting
long
enough
to
admire
every
article
furniture
in
room
from
sideboard
to
fender
to
give
an
account
their
journey
that
had
happened
in
london
mr
collins
invited
them
to
take
stroll
in
garden
which
was
large
well
laid
out
to
cultivation
which
he
attended
himself
to
work
in
garden
was
one
his
most
respectable
pleasures
elizabeth
admired
command
countenance
with
which
charlotte
talked
healthfulness
exercise
owned
she
encouraged
as
much
as
possible
here
leading
way
through
every
walk
cross
walk
scarcely
allowing
them
an
interval
to
utter
praises
he
asked
for
every
view
was
pointed
out
with
minuteness
which
left
beauty
entirely
behind
he
could
number
fields
in
every
direction
could
tell
how
many
tress
there
were
in
most
distant
clump
but
views
which
his
garden
or
which
country
or
kingdom
could
boast
none
were
to
be
compared
with
prospect
rosings
afforded
by
an
opening
in
trees
that
bordered
park
nearly
opposite
front
his
house
was
handsome
modern
building
well
situated
on
rising
ground
from
his
garden
mr
collins
would
led
them
round
his
two
meadows
but
ladies
not
having
shoes
to
encounter
remains
white
frost
turned
back
while
sir
william
accompanied
him
charlotte
took
her
sister
friend
over
house
extremely
well
pleased
probably
to
opportunity
showing
without
her
husband
s
help
was
rather
small
but
well
built
convenient
everything
was
fitted
up
arranged
with
neatness
consistency
which
elizabeth
gave
charlotte
credit
when
mr
collins
could
be
forgotten
there
was
really
an
air
great
comfort
throughout
by
charlotte
s
evident
enjoyment
elizabeth
supposed
he
must
be
often
forgotten
she
had
already
learnt
that
lady
catherine
was
still
in
country
was
spoken
again
while
they
were
at
dinner
when
mr
collins
joining
in
observed
yes
miss
elizabeth
you
will
honour
seeing
lady
catherine
de
bourgh
on
ensuing
sunday
at
church
need
not
say
you
will
be
delighted
with
her
she
affability
condescension
doubt
not
but
you
will
be
honoured
with
some
portion
her
notice
when
service
over
scarcely
any
hesitation
in
saying
she
will
include
you
my
sister
maria
in
every
invitation
with
which
she
honours
us
during
your
stay
here
her
behaviour
to
my
dear
charlotte
charming
we
dine
at
rosings
twice
every
week
never
allowed
to
walk
home
her
ladyship
s
carriage
regularly
ordered
for
us
say
one
her
ladyship
s
carriages
for
she
has
several
lady
catherine
very
respectable
sensible
woman
indeed
added
charlotte
most
attentive
neighbour
very
true
my
dear
that
exactly
what
say
she
sort
woman
whom
one
cannot
regard
with
too
much
deference
evening
was
spent
chiefly
in
talking
over
hertfordshire
news
telling
again
what
had
already
been
written
when
closed
elizabeth
in
solitude
her
chamber
had
to
meditate
upon
charlotte
s
degree
contentment
to
understand
her
address
in
guiding
composure
in
bearing
with
her
husband
to
acknowledge
that
was
done
very
well
she
had
also
to
anticipate
how
her
visit
would
pass
quiet
tenor
their
usual
employments
vexatious
interruptions
mr
collins
gaieties
their
intercourse
with
rosings
lively
imagination
soon
settled
about
middle
next
day
as
she
was
in
her
room
getting
ready
for
walk
sudden
noise
below
seemed
to
speak
whole
house
in
confusion
after
listening
moment
she
heard
somebody
running
upstairs
in
violent
hurry
calling
loudly
after
her
she
opened
door
met
maria
in
landing
place
who
breathless
with
agitation
cried
out
oh
my
dear
eliza
pray
make
haste
come
into
dining
room
for
there
such
sight
to
be
seen
will
not
tell
you
what
make
haste
come
down
moment
elizabeth
asked
questions
in
vain
maria
would
tell
her
nothing
more
down
they
ran
into
dining
room
which
fronted
lane
in
quest
wonder
was
two
ladies
stopping
in
low
phaeton
at
garden
gate
cried
elizabeth
expected
at
least
that
pigs
were
got
into
garden
here
nothing
but
lady
catherine
her
daughter
la
my
dear
said
maria
quite
shocked
at
mistake
not
lady
catherine
old
lady
mrs
jenkinson
who
lives
with
them
other
miss
de
bourgh
only
look
at
her
she
quite
little
creature
who
would
thought
that
she
could
be
so
thin
small
she
abominably
rude
to
keep
charlotte
out
doors
in
wind
why
does
she
not
come
in
oh
charlotte
says
she
hardly
ever
does
greatest
favours
when
miss
de
bourgh
comes
in
like
her
appearance
said
elizabeth
struck
with
other
ideas
she
looks
sickly
cross
yes
she
will
do
for
him
very
well
she
will
make
him
very
proper
wife
mr
collins
charlotte
were
both
standing
at
gate
in
conversation
with
ladies
sir
william
to
elizabeth
s
high
diversion
was
stationed
in
doorway
in
earnest
contemplation
greatness
before
him
constantly
bowing
whenever
miss
de
bourgh
looked
that
way
at
length
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
said
ladies
drove
on
others
returned
into
house
mr
collins
no
sooner
saw
two
girls
than
he
began
to
congratulate
them
on
their
good
fortune
which
charlotte
explained
by
letting
them
know
that
whole
party
was
asked
to
dine
at
rosings
next
day
chapter
mr
collins
s
triumph
in
consequence
invitation
was
complete
power
displaying
grandeur
his
patroness
to
his
wondering
visitors
letting
them
see
her
civility
towards
himself
his
wife
was
exactly
what
he
had
wished
for
that
an
opportunity
doing
be
given
so
soon
was
such
an
instance
lady
catherine
s
condescension
as
he
knew
not
how
to
admire
enough
confess
said
he
that
not
been
at
surprised
by
her
ladyship
s
asking
us
on
sunday
to
drink
tea
spend
evening
at
rosings
rather
expected
from
my
knowledge
her
affability
that
would
happen
but
who
could
foreseen
such
an
attention
as
who
could
imagined
that
we
receive
an
invitation
to
dine
there
an
invitation
moreover
including
whole
party
so
immediately
after
your
arrival
less
surprised
at
what
has
happened
replied
sir
william
from
that
knowledge
what
manners
great
really
which
my
situation
in
life
has
allowed
me
to
acquire
about
court
such
instances
elegant
breeding
not
uncommon
scarcely
anything
was
talked
whole
day
or
next
morning
but
their
visit
to
rosings
mr
collins
was
carefully
instructing
them
in
what
they
were
to
expect
that
sight
such
rooms
so
many
servants
so
splendid
dinner
might
not
wholly
overpower
them
when
ladies
were
separating
for
toilette
he
said
to
elizabeth
do
not
make
yourself
uneasy
my
dear
cousin
about
your
apparel
lady
catherine
far
from
requiring
that
elegance
dress
in
us
which
becomes
herself
her
daughter
would
advise
you
merely
to
put
on
whatever
your
clothes
superior
to
rest
there
no
occasion
for
anything
more
lady
catherine
will
not
think
worse
you
for
being
simply
dressed
she
likes
to
distinction
rank
preserved
while
they
were
dressing
he
came
two
or
times
to
their
different
doors
to
recommend
their
being
quick
as
lady
catherine
very
much
objected
to
be
kept
waiting
for
her
dinner
such
formidable
accounts
her
ladyship
her
manner
living
quite
frightened
maria
lucas
who
had
been
little
used
to
company
she
looked
forward
to
her
introduction
at
rosings
with
as
much
apprehension
as
her
father
had
done
to
his
presentation
at
st
james
s
as
weather
was
fine
they
had
pleasant
walk
about
half
mile
across
park
every
park
has
its
beauty
its
prospects
elizabeth
saw
much
to
be
pleased
with
though
she
could
not
be
in
such
raptures
as
mr
collins
expected
scene
to
inspire
was
but
slightly
affected
by
his
enumeration
windows
in
front
house
his
relation
what
glazing
altogether
had
originally
cost
sir
lewis
de
bourgh
when
they
ascended
steps
to
hall
maria
s
alarm
was
every
moment
increasing
even
sir
william
did
not
look
perfectly
calm
elizabeth
s
courage
did
not
fail
her
she
had
heard
nothing
lady
catherine
that
spoke
her
awful
from
any
extraordinary
talents
or
miraculous
virtue
mere
stateliness
money
or
rank
she
thought
she
could
witness
without
trepidation
from
entrance
hall
which
mr
collins
pointed
out
with
rapturous
air
fine
proportion
finished
ornaments
they
followed
servants
through
an
ante
chamber
to
room
where
lady
catherine
her
daughter
mrs
jenkinson
were
sitting
her
ladyship
with
great
condescension
arose
to
receive
them
as
mrs
collins
had
settled
with
her
husband
that
office
introduction
be
hers
was
performed
in
proper
manner
without
any
those
apologies
thanks
which
he
would
thought
necessary
in
spite
having
been
at
st
james
s
sir
william
was
so
completely
awed
by
grandeur
surrounding
him
that
he
had
but
just
courage
enough
to
make
very
low
bow
take
his
seat
without
saying
word
his
daughter
frightened
almost
out
her
senses
sat
on
edge
her
chair
not
knowing
which
way
to
look
elizabeth
found
herself
quite
equal
to
scene
could
observe
ladies
before
her
composedly
lady
catherine
was
tall
large
woman
with
strongly
marked
features
which
might
once
been
handsome
her
air
was
not
conciliating
nor
was
her
manner
receiving
them
such
as
to
make
her
visitors
forget
their
inferior
rank
she
was
not
rendered
formidable
by
silence
but
whatever
she
said
was
spoken
in
so
authoritative
tone
as
marked
her
self
importance
brought
mr
wickham
immediately
to
elizabeth
s
mind
from
observation
day
altogether
she
believed
lady
catherine
to
be
exactly
what
he
represented
when
after
examining
mother
in
whose
countenance
deportment
she
soon
found
some
resemblance
mr
darcy
she
turned
her
eyes
on
daughter
she
could
almost
joined
in
maria
s
astonishment
at
her
being
so
thin
so
small
there
was
neither
in
figure
nor
face
any
likeness
between
ladies
miss
de
bourgh
was
pale
sickly
her
features
though
not
plain
were
insignificant
she
spoke
very
little
except
in
low
voice
to
mrs
jenkinson
in
whose
appearance
there
was
nothing
remarkable
who
was
entirely
engaged
in
listening
to
what
she
said
placing
screen
in
proper
direction
before
her
eyes
after
sitting
few
minutes
they
were
sent
to
one
windows
to
admire
view
mr
collins
attending
them
to
point
out
its
beauties
lady
catherine
kindly
informing
them
that
was
much
better
worth
looking
at
in
summer
dinner
was
exceedingly
handsome
there
were
servants
articles
plate
which
mr
collins
had
promised
as
he
had
likewise
foretold
he
took
his
seat
at
bottom
table
by
her
ladyship
s
desire
looked
as
if
he
felt
that
life
could
furnish
nothing
greater
he
carved
ate
praised
with
delighted
alacrity
every
dish
was
commended
first
by
him
then
by
sir
william
who
was
now
enough
recovered
to
echo
whatever
his
son
in
law
said
in
manner
which
elizabeth
wondered
lady
catherine
could
bear
but
lady
catherine
seemed
gratified
by
their
excessive
admiration
gave
most
gracious
smiles
especially
when
any
dish
on
table
proved
novelty
to
them
party
did
not
supply
much
conversation
elizabeth
was
ready
to
speak
whenever
there
was
an
opening
but
she
was
seated
between
charlotte
miss
de
bourgh
former
whom
was
engaged
in
listening
to
lady
catherine
latter
said
not
word
to
her
dinner
time
mrs
jenkinson
was
chiefly
employed
in
watching
how
little
miss
de
bourgh
ate
pressing
her
to
try
some
other
dish
fearing
she
was
indisposed
maria
thought
speaking
out
question
gentlemen
did
nothing
but
eat
admire
when
ladies
returned
to
drawing
room
there
was
little
to
be
done
but
to
hear
lady
catherine
talk
which
she
did
without
any
intermission
till
coffee
came
in
delivering
her
opinion
on
every
subject
in
so
decisive
manner
as
proved
that
she
was
not
used
to
her
judgement
controverted
she
inquired
into
charlotte
s
domestic
concerns
familiarly
minutely
gave
her
great
deal
advice
as
to
management
them
told
her
how
everything
ought
to
be
regulated
in
so
small
family
as
hers
instructed
her
as
to
care
her
cows
her
poultry
elizabeth
found
that
nothing
was
beneath
great
lady
s
attention
which
could
furnish
her
with
an
occasion
dictating
to
others
in
intervals
her
discourse
with
mrs
collins
she
addressed
variety
questions
to
maria
elizabeth
but
especially
to
latter
whose
connections
she
knew
least
who
she
observed
to
mrs
collins
was
very
genteel
pretty
kind
girl
she
asked
her
at
different
times
how
many
sisters
she
had
whether
they
were
older
or
younger
than
herself
whether
any
them
were
likely
to
be
married
whether
they
were
handsome
where
they
had
been
educated
what
carriage
her
father
kept
what
had
been
her
mother
s
maiden
name
elizabeth
felt
impertinence
her
questions
but
answered
them
very
composedly
lady
catherine
then
observed
your
father
s
estate
entailed
on
mr
collins
think
for
your
sake
turning
to
charlotte
glad
but
otherwise
see
no
occasion
for
entailing
estates
from
female
line
was
not
thought
necessary
in
sir
lewis
de
bourgh
s
family
do
you
play
sing
miss
bennet
little
oh
then
some
time
or
other
we
shall
be
happy
to
hear
you
our
instrument
capital
one
probably
superior
to
you
shall
try
some
day
do
your
sisters
play
sing
one
them
does
why
did
not
you
learn
you
ought
to
learned
miss
webbs
play
their
father
has
not
so
good
an
income
as
yours
do
you
draw
no
not
at
what
none
you
not
one
that
very
strange
but
suppose
you
had
no
opportunity
your
mother
taken
you
to
town
every
spring
for
benefit
masters
my
mother
would
had
no
objection
but
my
father
hates
london
has
your
governess
left
you
we
never
had
any
governess
no
governess
how
was
that
possible
five
daughters
brought
up
at
home
without
governess
never
heard
such
thing
your
mother
must
been
quite
slave
to
your
education
elizabeth
could
hardly
help
smiling
as
she
assured
her
that
had
not
been
case
then
who
taught
you
who
attended
to
you
without
governess
you
must
been
neglected
compared
with
some
families
believe
we
were
but
such
us
as
wished
to
learn
never
wanted
means
we
were
always
encouraged
to
read
had
masters
that
were
necessary
those
who
chose
to
be
idle
certainly
might
aye
no
doubt
but
that
what
governess
will
prevent
if
had
known
your
mother
advised
her
most
strenuously
to
engage
one
always
say
that
nothing
to
be
done
in
education
without
steady
regular
instruction
nobody
but
governess
can
give
wonderful
how
many
families
been
means
supplying
in
that
way
always
glad
to
get
young
person
well
placed
out
four
nieces
mrs
jenkinson
most
delightfully
situated
through
my
means
was
but
other
day
that
recommended
another
young
person
who
was
merely
accidentally
mentioned
to
me
family
quite
delighted
with
her
mrs
collins
did
tell
you
lady
metcalf
s
calling
yesterday
to
thank
me
she
finds
miss
pope
treasure
lady
catherine
said
she
you
given
me
treasure
any
your
younger
sisters
out
miss
bennet
yes
ma
what
five
out
at
once
very
odd
you
only
younger
ones
out
before
elder
ones
married
your
younger
sisters
must
be
very
young
yes
my
youngest
not
sixteen
perhaps
she
full
young
to
be
much
in
company
but
really
ma
think
would
be
very
hard
upon
younger
sisters
that
they
not
their
share
society
amusement
because
elder
may
not
means
or
inclination
to
marry
early
last
born
has
as
good
right
to
pleasures
youth
at
first
to
be
kept
back
on
such
motive
think
would
not
be
very
likely
to
promote
sisterly
affection
or
delicacy
mind
upon
my
word
said
her
ladyship
you
give
your
opinion
very
decidedly
for
so
young
person
pray
what
your
age
with
younger
sisters
grown
up
replied
elizabeth
smiling
your
ladyship
can
hardly
expect
me
to
own
lady
catherine
seemed
quite
astonished
at
not
receiving
direct
answer
elizabeth
suspected
herself
to
be
first
creature
who
had
ever
dared
to
trifle
with
so
much
dignified
impertinence
you
cannot
be
more
than
twenty
sure
therefore
you
need
not
conceal
your
age
not
one
twenty
when
gentlemen
had
joined
them
tea
was
over
card
tables
were
placed
lady
catherine
sir
william
mr
mrs
collins
sat
down
to
quadrille
as
miss
de
bourgh
chose
to
play
at
cassino
two
girls
had
honour
assisting
mrs
jenkinson
to
make
up
her
party
their
table
was
superlatively
stupid
scarcely
syllable
was
uttered
that
did
not
relate
to
game
except
when
mrs
jenkinson
expressed
her
fears
miss
de
bourgh
s
being
too
hot
or
too
cold
or
having
too
much
or
too
little
light
great
deal
more
passed
at
other
table
lady
catherine
was
generally
speaking
stating
mistakes
others
or
relating
some
anecdote
herself
mr
collins
was
employed
in
agreeing
to
everything
her
ladyship
said
thanking
her
for
every
fish
he
won
apologising
if
he
thought
he
won
too
many
sir
william
did
not
say
much
he
was
storing
his
memory
with
anecdotes
noble
names
when
lady
catherine
her
daughter
had
played
as
long
as
they
chose
tables
were
broken
up
carriage
was
offered
to
mrs
collins
gratefully
accepted
immediately
ordered
party
then
gathered
round
fire
to
hear
lady
catherine
determine
what
weather
they
were
to
on
morrow
from
these
instructions
they
were
summoned
by
arrival
coach
with
many
speeches
thankfulness
on
mr
collins
s
side
as
many
bows
on
sir
william
s
they
departed
as
soon
as
they
had
driven
from
door
elizabeth
was
called
on
by
her
cousin
to
give
her
opinion
that
she
had
seen
at
rosings
which
for
charlotte
s
sake
she
made
more
favourable
than
really
was
but
her
commendation
though
costing
her
some
trouble
could
by
no
means
satisfy
mr
collins
he
was
very
soon
obliged
to
take
her
ladyship
s
praise
into
his
own
hands
chapter
sir
william
stayed
only
week
at
hunsford
but
his
visit
was
long
enough
to
convince
him
his
daughter
s
being
most
comfortably
settled
her
possessing
such
husband
such
neighbour
as
were
not
often
met
with
while
sir
william
was
with
them
mr
collins
devoted
his
morning
to
driving
him
out
in
his
gig
showing
him
country
but
when
he
went
away
whole
family
returned
to
their
usual
employments
elizabeth
was
thankful
to
find
that
they
did
not
see
more
her
cousin
by
alteration
for
chief
time
between
breakfast
dinner
was
now
passed
by
him
either
at
work
in
garden
or
in
reading
writing
looking
out
window
in
his
own
book
room
which
fronted
road
room
in
which
ladies
sat
was
backwards
elizabeth
had
at
first
rather
wondered
that
charlotte
not
prefer
dining
parlour
for
common
use
was
better
sized
room
had
more
pleasant
aspect
but
she
soon
saw
that
her
friend
had
an
excellent
reason
for
what
she
did
for
mr
collins
would
undoubtedly
been
much
less
in
his
own
apartment
had
they
sat
in
one
equally
lively
she
gave
charlotte
credit
for
arrangement
from
drawing
room
they
could
distinguish
nothing
in
lane
were
indebted
to
mr
collins
for
knowledge
what
carriages
went
along
how
often
especially
miss
de
bourgh
drove
by
in
her
phaeton
which
he
never
failed
coming
to
inform
them
though
happened
almost
every
day
she
not
unfrequently
stopped
at
parsonage
had
few
minutes
conversation
with
charlotte
but
was
scarcely
ever
prevailed
upon
to
get
out
very
few
days
passed
in
which
mr
collins
did
not
walk
to
rosings
not
many
in
which
his
wife
did
not
think
necessary
to
go
likewise
till
elizabeth
recollected
that
there
might
be
other
family
livings
to
be
disposed
she
could
not
understand
sacrifice
so
many
hours
now
then
they
were
honoured
with
call
from
her
ladyship
nothing
escaped
her
observation
that
was
passing
in
room
during
these
visits
she
examined
into
their
employments
looked
at
their
work
advised
them
to
do
differently
found
fault
with
arrangement
furniture
or
detected
housemaid
in
negligence
if
she
accepted
any
refreshment
seemed
to
do
only
for
sake
finding
out
that
mrs
collins
s
joints
meat
were
too
large
for
her
family
elizabeth
soon
perceived
that
though
great
lady
was
not
in
commission
peace
county
she
was
most
active
magistrate
in
her
own
parish
minutest
concerns
which
were
carried
to
her
by
mr
collins
whenever
any
cottagers
were
disposed
to
be
quarrelsome
discontented
or
too
poor
she
sallied
forth
into
village
to
settle
their
differences
silence
their
complaints
scold
them
into
harmony
plenty
entertainment
dining
at
rosings
was
repeated
about
twice
week
allowing
for
loss
sir
william
there
being
only
one
card
table
in
evening
every
such
entertainment
was
counterpart
first
their
other
engagements
were
few
as
style
living
in
neighbourhood
in
general
was
beyond
mr
collins
s
reach
however
was
no
evil
to
elizabeth
upon
whole
she
spent
her
time
comfortably
enough
there
were
half
hours
pleasant
conversation
with
charlotte
weather
was
so
fine
for
time
year
that
she
had
often
great
enjoyment
out
doors
her
favourite
walk
where
she
frequently
went
while
others
were
calling
on
lady
catherine
was
along
open
grove
which
edged
that
side
park
where
there
was
nice
sheltered
path
which
no
one
seemed
to
value
but
herself
where
she
felt
beyond
reach
lady
catherine
s
curiosity
in
quiet
way
first
fortnight
her
visit
soon
passed
away
easter
was
approaching
week
preceding
was
to
bring
an
addition
to
family
at
rosings
which
in
so
small
circle
must
be
important
elizabeth
had
heard
soon
after
her
arrival
that
mr
darcy
was
expected
there
in
course
few
weeks
though
there
were
not
many
her
acquaintances
whom
she
did
not
prefer
his
coming
would
furnish
one
comparatively
new
to
look
at
in
their
rosings
parties
she
might
be
amused
in
seeing
how
hopeless
miss
bingley
s
designs
on
him
were
by
his
behaviour
to
his
cousin
for
whom
he
was
evidently
destined
by
lady
catherine
who
talked
his
coming
with
greatest
satisfaction
spoke
him
in
terms
highest
admiration
seemed
almost
angry
to
find
that
he
had
already
been
frequently
seen
by
miss
lucas
herself
his
arrival
was
soon
known
at
parsonage
for
mr
collins
was
walking
whole
morning
within
view
lodges
opening
into
hunsford
lane
in
order
to
earliest
assurance
after
making
his
bow
as
carriage
turned
into
park
hurried
home
with
great
intelligence
on
following
morning
he
hastened
to
rosings
to
pay
his
respects
there
were
two
nephews
lady
catherine
to
require
them
for
mr
darcy
had
brought
with
him
colonel
fitzwilliam
younger
son
his
uncle
lord
to
great
surprise
party
when
mr
collins
returned
gentleman
accompanied
him
charlotte
had
seen
them
from
her
husband
s
room
crossing
road
immediately
running
into
other
told
girls
what
an
honour
they
might
expect
adding
may
thank
you
eliza
for
piece
civility
mr
darcy
would
never
come
so
soon
to
wait
upon
me
elizabeth
had
scarcely
time
to
disclaim
right
to
compliment
before
their
approach
was
announced
by
door
bell
shortly
afterwards
gentlemen
entered
room
colonel
fitzwilliam
who
led
way
was
about
thirty
not
handsome
but
in
person
address
most
truly
gentleman
mr
darcy
looked
just
as
he
had
been
used
to
look
in
hertfordshire
paid
his
compliments
with
his
usual
reserve
to
mrs
collins
whatever
might
be
his
feelings
toward
her
friend
met
her
with
every
appearance
composure
elizabeth
merely
curtseyed
to
him
without
saying
word
colonel
fitzwilliam
entered
into
conversation
directly
with
readiness
ease
well
bred
man
talked
very
pleasantly
but
his
cousin
after
having
addressed
slight
observation
on
house
garden
to
mrs
collins
sat
for
some
time
without
speaking
to
anybody
at
length
however
his
civility
was
so
far
awakened
as
to
inquire
elizabeth
after
health
her
family
she
answered
him
in
usual
way
after
moment
s
pause
added
my
eldest
sister
has
been
in
town
these
months
you
never
happened
to
see
her
there
she
was
perfectly
sensible
that
he
never
had
but
she
wished
to
see
whether
he
would
betray
any
consciousness
what
had
passed
between
bingleys
jane
she
thought
he
looked
little
confused
as
he
answered
that
he
had
never
been
so
fortunate
as
to
meet
miss
bennet
subject
was
pursued
no
farther
gentlemen
soon
afterwards
went
away
chapter
colonel
fitzwilliam
s
manners
were
very
much
admired
at
parsonage
ladies
felt
that
he
must
add
considerably
to
pleasures
their
engagements
at
rosings
was
some
days
however
before
they
received
any
invitation
thither
for
while
there
were
visitors
in
house
they
could
not
be
necessary
was
not
till
easter
day
almost
week
after
gentlemen
s
arrival
that
they
were
honoured
by
such
an
attention
then
they
were
merely
asked
on
leaving
church
to
come
there
in
evening
for
last
week
they
had
seen
very
little
lady
catherine
or
her
daughter
colonel
fitzwilliam
had
called
at
parsonage
more
than
once
during
time
but
mr
darcy
they
had
seen
only
at
church
invitation
was
accepted
course
at
proper
hour
they
joined
party
in
lady
catherine
s
drawing
room
her
ladyship
received
them
civilly
but
was
plain
that
their
company
was
by
no
means
so
acceptable
as
when
she
could
get
nobody
else
she
was
in
fact
almost
engrossed
by
her
nephews
speaking
to
them
especially
to
darcy
much
more
than
to
any
other
person
in
room
colonel
fitzwilliam
seemed
really
glad
to
see
them
anything
was
welcome
relief
to
him
at
rosings
mrs
collins
s
pretty
friend
had
moreover
caught
his
fancy
very
much
he
now
seated
himself
by
her
talked
so
agreeably
kent
hertfordshire
travelling
staying
at
home
new
books
music
that
elizabeth
had
never
been
half
so
well
entertained
in
that
room
before
they
conversed
with
so
much
spirit
flow
as
to
draw
attention
lady
catherine
herself
as
well
as
mr
darcy
his
eyes
had
been
soon
repeatedly
turned
towards
them
with
look
curiosity
that
her
ladyship
after
while
shared
feeling
was
more
openly
acknowledged
for
she
did
not
scruple
to
call
out
what
that
you
saying
fitzwilliam
what
you
talking
what
you
telling
miss
bennet
let
me
hear
what
we
speaking
music
madam
said
he
when
no
longer
able
to
avoid
reply
music
then
pray
speak
aloud
subjects
my
delight
must
my
share
in
conversation
if
you
speaking
music
there
few
people
in
england
suppose
who
more
true
enjoyment
music
than
myself
or
better
natural
taste
if
had
ever
learnt
been
great
proficient
so
would
anne
if
her
health
had
allowed
her
to
apply
confident
that
she
would
performed
delightfully
how
does
georgiana
get
on
darcy
mr
darcy
spoke
with
affectionate
praise
his
sister
s
proficiency
very
glad
to
hear
such
good
account
her
said
lady
catherine
pray
tell
her
from
me
that
she
cannot
expect
to
excel
if
she
does
not
practice
good
deal
assure
you
madam
he
replied
that
she
does
not
need
such
advice
she
practises
very
constantly
so
much
better
cannot
be
done
too
much
when
next
write
to
her
shall
charge
her
not
to
neglect
on
any
account
often
tell
young
ladies
that
no
excellence
in
music
to
be
acquired
without
constant
practice
told
miss
bennet
several
times
that
she
will
never
play
really
well
unless
she
practises
more
though
mrs
collins
has
no
instrument
she
very
welcome
as
often
told
her
to
come
to
rosings
every
day
play
on
pianoforte
in
mrs
jenkinson
s
room
she
would
be
in
nobody
s
way
you
know
in
that
part
house
mr
darcy
looked
little
ashamed
his
aunt
s
ill
breeding
made
no
answer
when
coffee
was
over
colonel
fitzwilliam
reminded
elizabeth
having
promised
to
play
to
him
she
sat
down
directly
to
instrument
he
drew
chair
near
her
lady
catherine
listened
to
half
song
then
talked
as
before
to
her
other
nephew
till
latter
walked
away
from
her
making
with
his
usual
deliberation
towards
pianoforte
stationed
himself
so
as
to
command
full
view
fair
performer
s
countenance
elizabeth
saw
what
he
was
doing
at
first
convenient
pause
turned
to
him
with
an
arch
smile
said
you
mean
to
frighten
me
mr
darcy
by
coming
in
state
to
hear
me
will
not
be
alarmed
though
your
sister
does
play
so
well
there
stubbornness
about
me
that
never
can
bear
to
be
frightened
at
will
others
my
courage
always
rises
at
every
attempt
to
intimidate
me
shall
not
say
you
mistaken
he
replied
because
you
could
not
really
believe
me
to
entertain
any
design
alarming
you
had
pleasure
your
acquaintance
long
enough
to
know
that
you
find
great
enjoyment
in
occasionally
professing
opinions
which
in
fact
not
your
own
elizabeth
laughed
heartily
at
picture
herself
said
to
colonel
fitzwilliam
your
cousin
will
give
you
very
pretty
notion
me
teach
you
not
to
believe
word
say
particularly
unlucky
in
meeting
with
person
so
able
to
expose
my
real
character
in
part
world
where
had
hoped
to
pass
myself
off
with
some
degree
credit
indeed
mr
darcy
very
ungenerous
in
you
to
mention
that
you
knew
to
my
disadvantage
in
hertfordshire
give
me
leave
to
say
very
impolitic
too
for
provoking
me
to
retaliate
such
things
may
come
out
as
will
shock
your
relations
to
hear
not
afraid
you
said
he
smilingly
pray
let
me
hear
what
you
to
accuse
him
cried
colonel
fitzwilliam
like
to
know
how
he
behaves
among
strangers
you
shall
hear
then
but
prepare
yourself
for
something
very
dreadful
first
time
my
ever
seeing
him
in
hertfordshire
you
must
know
was
at
ball
at
ball
what
do
you
think
he
did
he
danced
only
four
dances
though
gentlemen
were
scarce
to
my
certain
knowledge
more
than
one
young
lady
was
sitting
down
in
want
partner
mr
darcy
you
cannot
deny
fact
had
not
at
that
time
honour
knowing
any
lady
in
assembly
beyond
my
own
party
true
nobody
can
ever
be
introduced
in
ball
room
well
colonel
fitzwilliam
what
do
play
next
my
fingers
wait
your
orders
perhaps
said
darcy
judged
better
had
sought
an
introduction
but
ill
qualified
to
recommend
myself
to
strangers
shall
we
ask
your
cousin
reason
said
elizabeth
still
addressing
colonel
fitzwilliam
shall
we
ask
him
why
man
sense
education
who
has
lived
in
world
ill
qualified
to
recommend
himself
to
strangers
can
answer
your
question
said
fitzwilliam
without
applying
to
him
because
he
will
not
give
himself
trouble
certainly
not
talent
which
some
people
possess
said
darcy
conversing
easily
with
those
never
seen
before
cannot
catch
their
tone
conversation
or
appear
interested
in
their
concerns
as
often
see
done
my
fingers
said
elizabeth
do
not
move
over
instrument
in
masterly
manner
which
see
so
many
women
s
do
they
not
same
force
or
rapidity
do
not
produce
same
expression
but
then
always
supposed
to
be
my
own
fault
because
will
not
take
trouble
practising
not
that
do
not
believe
my
fingers
as
capable
as
any
other
woman
s
superior
execution
darcy
smiled
said
you
perfectly
right
you
employed
your
time
much
better
no
one
admitted
to
privilege
hearing
you
can
think
anything
wanting
we
neither
us
perform
to
strangers
here
they
were
interrupted
by
lady
catherine
who
called
out
to
know
what
they
were
talking
elizabeth
immediately
began
playing
again
lady
catherine
approached
after
listening
for
few
minutes
said
to
darcy
miss
bennet
would
not
play
at
amiss
if
she
practised
more
could
advantage
london
master
she
has
very
good
notion
fingering
though
her
taste
not
equal
to
anne
s
anne
would
been
delightful
performer
had
her
health
allowed
her
to
learn
elizabeth
looked
at
darcy
to
see
how
cordially
he
assented
to
his
cousin
s
praise
but
neither
at
that
moment
nor
at
any
other
could
she
discern
any
symptom
love
from
whole
his
behaviour
to
miss
de
bourgh
she
derived
comfort
for
miss
bingley
that
he
might
been
just
as
likely
to
marry
her
had
she
been
his
relation
lady
catherine
continued
her
remarks
on
elizabeth
s
performance
mixing
with
them
many
instructions
on
execution
taste
elizabeth
received
them
with
forbearance
civility
at
request
gentlemen
remained
at
instrument
till
her
ladyship
s
carriage
was
ready
to
take
them
home
chapter
elizabeth
was
sitting
by
herself
next
morning
writing
to
jane
while
mrs
collins
maria
were
gone
on
business
into
village
when
she
was
startled
by
ring
at
door
certain
signal
visitor
as
she
had
heard
no
carriage
she
thought
not
unlikely
to
be
lady
catherine
under
that
apprehension
was
putting
away
her
half
finished
letter
that
she
might
escape
impertinent
questions
when
door
opened
to
her
very
great
surprise
mr
darcy
mr
darcy
only
entered
room
he
seemed
astonished
too
on
finding
her
alone
apologised
for
his
intrusion
by
letting
her
know
that
he
had
understood
ladies
were
to
be
within
they
then
sat
down
when
her
inquiries
after
rosings
were
made
seemed
in
danger
sinking
into
total
silence
was
absolutely
necessary
therefore
to
think
something
in
emergence
recollecting
when
she
had
seen
him
last
in
hertfordshire
feeling
curious
to
know
what
he
would
say
on
subject
their
hasty
departure
she
observed
how
very
suddenly
you
quitted
netherfield
last
november
mr
darcy
must
been
most
agreeable
surprise
to
mr
bingley
to
see
you
after
him
so
soon
for
if
recollect
right
he
went
but
day
before
he
his
sisters
were
well
hope
when
you
left
london
perfectly
so
thank
you
she
found
that
she
was
to
receive
no
other
answer
after
short
pause
added
think
understood
that
mr
bingley
has
not
much
idea
ever
returning
to
netherfield
again
never
heard
him
say
so
but
probable
that
he
may
spend
very
little
his
time
there
in
future
he
has
many
friends
at
time
life
when
friends
engagements
continually
increasing
if
he
means
to
be
but
little
at
netherfield
would
be
better
for
neighbourhood
that
he
give
up
place
entirely
for
then
we
might
possibly
get
settled
family
there
but
perhaps
mr
bingley
did
not
take
house
so
much
for
convenience
neighbourhood
as
for
his
own
we
must
expect
him
to
keep
or
quit
on
same
principle
not
be
surprised
said
darcy
if
he
were
to
give
up
as
soon
as
any
eligible
purchase
offers
elizabeth
made
no
answer
she
was
afraid
talking
longer
his
friend
having
nothing
else
to
say
was
now
determined
to
leave
trouble
finding
subject
to
him
he
took
hint
soon
began
with
seems
very
comfortable
house
lady
catherine
believe
did
great
deal
to
when
mr
collins
first
came
to
hunsford
believe
she
did
sure
she
could
not
bestowed
her
kindness
on
more
grateful
object
mr
collins
appears
to
be
very
fortunate
in
his
choice
wife
yes
indeed
his
friends
may
well
rejoice
in
his
having
met
with
one
very
few
sensible
women
who
would
accepted
him
or
made
him
happy
if
they
had
my
friend
has
an
excellent
understanding
though
not
certain
that
consider
her
marrying
mr
collins
as
wisest
thing
she
ever
did
she
seems
perfectly
happy
however
in
prudential
light
certainly
very
good
match
for
her
must
be
very
agreeable
for
her
to
be
settled
within
so
easy
distance
her
own
family
friends
an
easy
distance
do
you
call
nearly
fifty
miles
what
fifty
miles
good
road
little
more
than
half
day
s
journey
yes
call
very
easy
distance
never
considered
distance
as
one
advantages
match
cried
elizabeth
never
said
mrs
collins
was
settled
near
her
family
proof
your
own
attachment
to
hertfordshire
anything
beyond
very
neighbourhood
longbourn
suppose
would
appear
far
as
he
spoke
there
was
sort
smile
which
elizabeth
fancied
she
understood
he
must
be
supposing
her
to
be
thinking
jane
netherfield
she
blushed
as
she
answered
do
not
mean
to
say
that
woman
may
not
be
settled
too
near
her
family
far
near
must
be
relative
depend
on
many
varying
circumstances
where
there
fortune
to
make
expenses
travelling
unimportant
distance
becomes
no
evil
but
that
not
case
here
mr
mrs
collins
comfortable
income
but
not
such
one
as
will
allow
frequent
journeys
persuaded
my
friend
would
not
call
herself
near
her
family
under
less
than
half
present
distance
mr
darcy
drew
his
chair
little
towards
her
said
you
cannot
right
to
such
very
strong
local
attachment
you
cannot
been
always
at
longbourn
elizabeth
looked
surprised
gentleman
experienced
some
change
feeling
he
drew
back
his
chair
took
newspaper
from
table
glancing
over
said
in
colder
voice
you
pleased
with
kent
short
dialogue
on
subject
country
ensued
on
either
side
calm
concise
soon
put
an
end
to
by
entrance
charlotte
her
sister
just
returned
from
her
walk
tete
tete
surprised
them
mr
darcy
related
mistake
which
had
occasioned
his
intruding
on
miss
bennet
after
sitting
few
minutes
longer
without
saying
much
to
anybody
went
away
what
can
be
meaning
said
charlotte
as
soon
as
he
was
gone
my
dear
eliza
he
must
be
in
love
with
you
or
he
would
never
called
us
in
familiar
way
but
when
elizabeth
told
his
silence
did
not
seem
very
likely
even
to
charlotte
s
wishes
to
be
case
after
various
conjectures
they
could
at
last
only
suppose
his
visit
to
proceed
from
difficulty
finding
anything
to
do
which
was
more
probable
from
time
year
field
sports
were
over
within
doors
there
was
lady
catherine
books
billiard
table
but
gentlemen
cannot
always
be
within
doors
in
nearness
parsonage
or
pleasantness
walk
to
or
people
who
lived
in
two
cousins
found
temptation
from
period
walking
thither
almost
every
day
they
called
at
various
times
morning
sometimes
separately
sometimes
together
now
then
accompanied
by
their
aunt
was
plain
to
them
that
colonel
fitzwilliam
came
because
he
had
pleasure
in
their
society
persuasion
which
course
recommended
him
still
more
elizabeth
was
reminded
by
her
own
satisfaction
in
being
with
him
as
well
as
by
his
evident
admiration
her
her
former
favourite
george
wickham
though
in
comparing
them
she
saw
there
was
less
captivating
softness
in
colonel
fitzwilliam
s
manners
she
believed
he
might
best
informed
mind
but
why
mr
darcy
came
so
often
to
parsonage
was
more
difficult
to
understand
could
not
be
for
society
as
he
frequently
sat
there
ten
minutes
together
without
opening
his
lips
when
he
did
speak
seemed
effect
necessity
rather
than
choice
sacrifice
to
propriety
not
pleasure
to
himself
he
seldom
appeared
really
animated
mrs
collins
knew
not
what
to
make
him
colonel
fitzwilliam
s
occasionally
laughing
at
his
stupidity
proved
that
he
was
generally
different
which
her
own
knowledge
him
could
not
told
her
as
she
would
liked
to
believed
change
effect
love
object
that
love
her
friend
eliza
she
set
herself
seriously
to
work
to
find
out
she
watched
him
whenever
they
were
at
rosings
whenever
he
came
to
hunsford
but
without
much
success
he
certainly
looked
at
her
friend
great
deal
but
expression
that
look
was
disputable
was
an
earnest
steadfast
gaze
but
she
often
doubted
whether
there
were
much
admiration
in
sometimes
seemed
nothing
but
absence
mind
she
had
once
or
twice
suggested
to
elizabeth
possibility
his
being
partial
to
her
but
elizabeth
always
laughed
at
idea
mrs
collins
did
not
think
right
to
press
subject
from
danger
raising
expectations
which
might
only
end
in
disappointment
for
in
her
opinion
admitted
not
doubt
that
her
friend
s
dislike
would
vanish
if
she
could
suppose
him
to
be
in
her
power
in
her
kind
schemes
for
elizabeth
she
sometimes
planned
her
marrying
colonel
fitzwilliam
he
was
beyond
comparison
most
pleasant
man
he
certainly
admired
her
his
situation
in
life
was
most
eligible
but
to
counterbalance
these
advantages
mr
darcy
had
considerable
patronage
in
church
his
cousin
could
none
at
chapter
more
than
once
did
elizabeth
in
her
ramble
within
park
unexpectedly
meet
mr
darcy
she
felt
perverseness
mischance
that
bring
him
where
no
one
else
was
brought
to
prevent
its
ever
happening
again
took
care
to
inform
him
at
first
that
was
favourite
haunt
hers
how
could
occur
time
therefore
was
very
odd
yet
did
even
seemed
like
wilful
ill
nature
or
voluntary
penance
for
on
these
occasions
was
not
merely
few
formal
inquiries
an
awkward
pause
then
away
but
he
actually
thought
necessary
to
turn
back
walk
with
her
he
never
said
great
deal
nor
did
she
give
herself
trouble
talking
or
listening
much
but
struck
her
in
course
their
rencontre
that
he
was
asking
some
odd
unconnected
questions
about
her
pleasure
in
being
at
hunsford
her
love
solitary
walks
her
opinion
mr
mrs
collins
s
happiness
that
in
speaking
rosings
her
not
perfectly
understanding
house
he
seemed
to
expect
that
whenever
she
came
into
kent
again
she
would
be
staying
there
too
his
words
seemed
to
imply
could
he
colonel
fitzwilliam
in
his
thoughts
she
supposed
if
he
meant
anything
he
must
mean
an
allusion
to
what
might
arise
in
that
quarter
distressed
her
little
she
was
quite
glad
to
find
herself
at
gate
in
pales
opposite
parsonage
she
was
engaged
one
day
as
she
walked
in
perusing
jane
s
last
letter
dwelling
on
some
passages
which
proved
that
jane
had
not
written
in
spirits
when
instead
being
again
surprised
by
mr
darcy
she
saw
on
looking
up
that
colonel
fitzwilliam
was
meeting
her
putting
away
letter
immediately
forcing
smile
she
said
did
not
know
before
that
you
ever
walked
way
been
making
tour
park
he
replied
as
generally
do
every
year
intend
to
close
with
call
at
parsonage
you
going
much
farther
no
turned
in
moment
accordingly
she
did
turn
they
walked
towards
parsonage
together
do
you
certainly
leave
kent
on
saturday
said
she
yes
if
darcy
does
not
put
off
again
but
at
his
disposal
he
arranges
business
just
as
he
pleases
if
not
able
to
please
himself
in
arrangement
he
has
at
least
pleasure
in
great
power
choice
do
not
know
anybody
who
seems
more
to
enjoy
power
doing
what
he
likes
than
mr
darcy
he
likes
to
his
own
way
very
well
replied
colonel
fitzwilliam
but
so
we
do
only
that
he
has
better
means
having
than
many
others
because
he
rich
many
others
poor
speak
feelingly
younger
son
you
know
must
be
inured
to
self
denial
dependence
in
my
opinion
younger
son
an
earl
can
know
very
little
either
now
seriously
what
you
ever
known
self
denial
dependence
when
you
been
prevented
by
want
money
from
going
wherever
you
chose
or
procuring
anything
you
had
fancy
for
these
home
questions
perhaps
cannot
say
that
experienced
many
hardships
that
nature
but
in
matters
greater
weight
may
suffer
from
want
money
younger
sons
cannot
marry
where
they
like
unless
where
they
like
women
fortune
which
think
they
very
often
do
our
habits
expense
make
us
too
dependent
there
not
many
in
my
rank
life
who
can
afford
to
marry
without
some
attention
to
money
thought
elizabeth
meant
for
me
she
coloured
at
idea
but
recovering
herself
said
in
lively
tone
pray
what
usual
price
an
earl
s
younger
son
unless
elder
brother
very
sickly
suppose
you
would
not
ask
above
fifty
thousand
pounds
he
answered
her
in
same
style
subject
dropped
to
interrupt
silence
which
might
make
him
fancy
her
affected
with
what
had
passed
she
soon
afterwards
said
imagine
your
cousin
brought
you
down
with
him
chiefly
for
sake
having
someone
at
his
disposal
wonder
he
does
not
marry
to
secure
lasting
convenience
that
kind
but
perhaps
his
sister
does
as
well
for
present
as
she
under
his
sole
care
he
may
do
what
he
likes
with
her
no
said
colonel
fitzwilliam
that
an
advantage
which
he
must
divide
with
me
joined
with
him
in
guardianship
miss
darcy
you
indeed
pray
what
sort
guardians
do
you
make
does
your
charge
give
you
much
trouble
young
ladies
her
age
sometimes
little
difficult
to
manage
if
she
has
true
darcy
spirit
she
may
like
to
her
own
way
as
she
spoke
she
observed
him
looking
at
her
earnestly
manner
in
which
he
immediately
asked
her
why
she
supposed
miss
darcy
likely
to
give
them
any
uneasiness
convinced
her
that
she
had
somehow
or
other
got
pretty
near
truth
she
directly
replied
you
need
not
be
frightened
never
heard
any
harm
her
dare
say
she
one
most
tractable
creatures
in
world
she
very
great
favourite
with
some
ladies
my
acquaintance
mrs
hurst
miss
bingley
think
heard
you
say
that
you
know
them
know
them
little
their
brother
pleasant
gentlemanlike
man
he
great
friend
darcy
s
oh
yes
said
elizabeth
drily
mr
darcy
uncommonly
kind
to
mr
bingley
takes
prodigious
deal
care
him
care
him
yes
really
believe
darcy
does
take
care
him
in
those
points
where
he
most
wants
care
from
something
that
he
told
me
in
our
journey
hither
reason
to
think
bingley
very
much
indebted
to
him
but
ought
to
beg
his
pardon
for
no
right
to
suppose
that
bingley
was
person
meant
was
conjecture
what
you
mean
circumstance
which
darcy
could
not
wish
to
be
generally
known
because
if
were
to
get
round
to
lady
s
family
would
be
an
unpleasant
thing
you
may
depend
upon
my
not
mentioning
remember
that
not
much
reason
for
supposing
to
be
bingley
what
he
told
me
was
merely
that
he
congratulated
himself
on
having
lately
saved
friend
from
inconveniences
most
imprudent
marriage
but
without
mentioning
names
or
any
other
particulars
only
suspected
to
be
bingley
from
believing
him
kind
young
man
to
get
into
scrape
that
sort
from
knowing
them
to
been
together
whole
last
summer
did
mr
darcy
give
you
reasons
for
interference
understood
that
there
were
some
very
strong
objections
against
lady
what
arts
did
he
use
to
separate
them
he
did
not
talk
to
me
his
own
arts
said
fitzwilliam
smiling
he
only
told
me
what
now
told
you
elizabeth
made
no
answer
walked
on
her
heart
swelling
with
indignation
after
watching
her
little
fitzwilliam
asked
her
why
she
was
so
thoughtful
thinking
what
you
been
telling
me
said
she
your
cousin
s
conduct
does
not
suit
my
feelings
why
was
he
to
be
judge
you
rather
disposed
to
call
his
interference
officious
do
not
see
what
right
mr
darcy
had
to
decide
on
propriety
his
friend
s
inclination
or
why
upon
his
own
judgement
alone
he
was
to
determine
direct
in
what
manner
his
friend
was
to
be
happy
but
she
continued
recollecting
herself
as
we
know
none
particulars
not
fair
to
condemn
him
not
to
be
supposed
that
there
was
much
affection
in
case
that
not
an
unnatural
surmise
said
fitzwilliam
but
lessening
honour
my
cousin
s
triumph
very
sadly
was
spoken
jestingly
but
appeared
to
her
so
just
picture
mr
darcy
that
she
would
not
trust
herself
with
an
answer
therefore
abruptly
changing
conversation
talked
on
indifferent
matters
until
they
reached
parsonage
there
shut
into
her
own
room
as
soon
as
their
visitor
left
them
she
could
think
without
interruption
that
she
had
heard
was
not
to
be
supposed
that
any
other
people
could
be
meant
than
those
with
whom
she
was
connected
there
could
not
exist
in
world
two
men
over
whom
mr
darcy
could
such
boundless
influence
that
he
had
been
concerned
in
measures
taken
to
separate
bingley
jane
she
had
never
doubted
but
she
had
always
attributed
to
miss
bingley
principal
design
arrangement
them
if
his
own
vanity
however
did
not
mislead
him
he
was
cause
his
pride
caprice
were
cause
that
jane
had
suffered
still
continued
to
suffer
he
had
ruined
for
while
every
hope
happiness
for
most
affectionate
generous
heart
in
world
no
one
could
say
how
lasting
an
evil
he
might
inflicted
there
were
some
very
strong
objections
against
lady
were
colonel
fitzwilliam
s
words
those
strong
objections
probably
were
her
having
one
uncle
who
was
country
attorney
another
who
was
in
business
in
london
to
jane
herself
she
exclaimed
there
could
be
no
possibility
objection
loveliness
goodness
as
she
her
understanding
excellent
her
mind
improved
her
manners
captivating
neither
could
anything
be
urged
against
my
father
who
though
with
some
peculiarities
has
abilities
mr
darcy
himself
need
not
disdain
respectability
which
he
will
probably
never
each
when
she
thought
her
mother
her
confidence
gave
way
little
but
she
would
not
allow
that
any
objections
there
had
material
weight
with
mr
darcy
whose
pride
she
was
convinced
would
receive
deeper
wound
from
want
importance
in
his
friend
s
connections
than
from
their
want
sense
she
was
quite
decided
at
last
that
he
had
been
partly
governed
by
worst
kind
pride
partly
by
wish
retaining
mr
bingley
for
his
sister
agitation
tears
which
subject
occasioned
brought
on
headache
grew
so
much
worse
towards
evening
that
added
to
her
unwillingness
to
see
mr
darcy
determined
her
not
to
attend
her
cousins
to
rosings
where
they
were
engaged
to
drink
tea
mrs
collins
seeing
that
she
was
really
unwell
did
not
press
her
to
go
as
much
as
possible
prevented
her
husband
from
pressing
her
but
mr
collins
could
not
conceal
his
apprehension
lady
catherine
s
being
rather
displeased
by
her
staying
at
home
chapter
when
they
were
gone
elizabeth
as
if
intending
to
exasperate
herself
as
much
as
possible
against
mr
darcy
chose
for
her
employment
examination
letters
which
jane
had
written
to
her
since
her
being
in
kent
they
contained
no
actual
complaint
nor
was
there
any
revival
past
occurrences
or
any
communication
present
suffering
but
in
in
almost
every
line
each
there
was
want
that
cheerfulness
which
had
been
used
to
characterise
her
style
which
proceeding
from
serenity
mind
at
ease
with
itself
kindly
disposed
towards
everyone
had
been
scarcely
ever
clouded
elizabeth
noticed
every
sentence
conveying
idea
uneasiness
with
an
attention
which
had
hardly
received
on
first
perusal
mr
darcy
s
shameful
boast
what
misery
he
had
been
able
to
inflict
gave
her
keener
sense
her
sister
s
sufferings
was
some
consolation
to
think
that
his
visit
to
rosings
was
to
end
on
day
after
next
still
greater
that
in
less
than
fortnight
she
herself
be
with
jane
again
enabled
to
contribute
to
recovery
her
spirits
by
that
affection
could
do
she
could
not
think
darcy
s
leaving
kent
without
remembering
that
his
cousin
was
to
go
with
him
but
colonel
fitzwilliam
had
made
clear
that
he
had
no
intentions
at
agreeable
as
he
was
she
did
not
mean
to
be
unhappy
about
him
while
settling
point
she
was
suddenly
roused
by
sound
door
bell
her
spirits
were
little
fluttered
by
idea
its
being
colonel
fitzwilliam
himself
who
had
once
before
called
late
in
evening
might
now
come
to
inquire
particularly
after
her
but
idea
was
soon
banished
her
spirits
were
very
differently
affected
when
to
her
utter
amazement
she
saw
mr
darcy
walk
into
room
in
an
hurried
manner
he
immediately
began
an
inquiry
after
her
health
imputing
his
visit
to
wish
hearing
that
she
were
better
she
answered
him
with
cold
civility
he
sat
down
for
few
moments
then
getting
up
walked
about
room
elizabeth
was
surprised
but
said
not
word
after
silence
several
minutes
he
came
towards
her
in
an
agitated
manner
thus
began
in
vain
struggled
will
not
do
my
feelings
will
not
be
repressed
you
must
allow
me
to
tell
you
how
ardently
admire
love
you
elizabeth
s
astonishment
was
beyond
expression
she
stared
coloured
doubted
was
silent
he
considered
sufficient
encouragement
avowal
that
he
felt
had
long
felt
for
her
immediately
followed
he
spoke
well
but
there
were
feelings
besides
those
heart
to
be
detailed
he
was
not
more
eloquent
on
subject
tenderness
than
pride
his
sense
her
inferiority
its
being
degradation
family
obstacles
which
had
always
opposed
to
inclination
were
dwelt
on
with
warmth
which
seemed
due
to
consequence
he
was
wounding
but
was
very
unlikely
to
recommend
his
suit
in
spite
her
deeply
rooted
dislike
she
could
not
be
insensible
to
compliment
such
man
s
affection
though
her
intentions
did
not
vary
for
an
instant
she
was
at
first
sorry
for
pain
he
was
to
receive
till
roused
to
resentment
by
his
subsequent
language
she
lost
compassion
in
anger
she
tried
however
to
compose
herself
to
answer
him
with
patience
when
he
done
he
concluded
with
representing
to
her
strength
that
attachment
which
in
spite
his
endeavours
he
had
found
impossible
to
conquer
with
expressing
his
hope
that
would
now
be
rewarded
by
her
acceptance
his
hand
as
he
said
she
could
easily
see
that
he
had
no
doubt
favourable
answer
he
spoke
apprehension
anxiety
but
his
countenance
expressed
real
security
such
circumstance
could
only
exasperate
farther
when
he
ceased
colour
rose
into
her
cheeks
she
said
in
such
cases
as
believe
established
mode
to
express
sense
obligation
for
sentiments
avowed
however
unequally
they
may
be
returned
natural
that
obligation
be
felt
if
could
feel
gratitude
would
now
thank
you
but
cannot
never
desired
your
good
opinion
you
certainly
bestowed
most
unwillingly
sorry
to
occasioned
pain
to
anyone
has
been
most
unconsciously
done
however
hope
will
be
short
duration
feelings
which
you
tell
me
long
prevented
acknowledgment
your
regard
can
little
difficulty
in
overcoming
after
explanation
mr
darcy
who
was
leaning
against
mantelpiece
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
her
face
seemed
to
catch
her
words
with
no
less
resentment
than
surprise
his
complexion
became
pale
with
anger
disturbance
his
mind
was
visible
in
every
feature
he
was
struggling
for
appearance
composure
would
not
open
his
lips
till
he
believed
himself
to
attained
pause
was
to
elizabeth
s
feelings
dreadful
at
length
with
voice
forced
calmness
he
said
reply
which
to
honour
expecting
might
perhaps
wish
to
be
informed
why
with
so
little
endeavour
at
civility
thus
rejected
but
small
importance
might
as
well
inquire
replied
she
why
with
so
evident
desire
offending
insulting
me
you
chose
to
tell
me
that
you
liked
me
against
your
will
against
your
reason
even
against
your
character
was
not
some
excuse
for
incivility
if
was
uncivil
but
other
provocations
you
know
had
not
my
feelings
decided
against
you
had
they
been
indifferent
or
had
they
even
been
favourable
do
you
think
that
any
consideration
would
tempt
me
to
accept
man
who
has
been
means
ruining
perhaps
for
ever
happiness
most
beloved
sister
as
she
pronounced
these
words
mr
darcy
changed
colour
but
emotion
was
short
he
listened
without
attempting
to
interrupt
her
while
she
continued
every
reason
in
world
to
think
ill
you
no
motive
can
excuse
unjust
ungenerous
part
you
acted
there
you
dare
not
you
cannot
deny
that
you
been
principal
if
not
only
means
dividing
them
from
each
other
exposing
one
to
censure
world
for
caprice
instability
other
to
its
derision
for
disappointed
hopes
involving
them
both
in
misery
acutest
kind
she
paused
saw
with
no
slight
indignation
that
he
was
listening
with
an
air
which
proved
him
wholly
unmoved
by
any
feeling
remorse
he
even
looked
at
her
with
smile
affected
incredulity
can
you
deny
that
you
done
she
repeated
with
assumed
tranquillity
he
then
replied
no
wish
denying
that
did
everything
in
my
power
to
separate
my
friend
from
your
sister
or
that
rejoice
in
my
success
towards
him
been
kinder
than
towards
myself
elizabeth
disdained
appearance
noticing
civil
reflection
but
its
meaning
did
not
escape
nor
was
likely
to
conciliate
her
but
not
merely
affair
she
continued
on
which
my
dislike
founded
long
before
had
taken
place
my
opinion
you
was
decided
your
character
was
unfolded
in
recital
which
received
many
months
ago
from
mr
wickham
on
subject
what
can
you
to
say
in
what
imaginary
act
friendship
can
you
here
defend
yourself
or
under
what
misrepresentation
can
you
here
impose
upon
others
you
take
an
eager
interest
in
that
gentleman
s
concerns
said
darcy
in
less
tranquil
tone
with
heightened
colour
who
that
knows
what
his
misfortunes
been
can
help
feeling
an
interest
in
him
his
misfortunes
repeated
darcy
contemptuously
yes
his
misfortunes
been
great
indeed
your
infliction
cried
elizabeth
with
energy
you
reduced
him
to
his
present
state
poverty
comparative
poverty
you
withheld
advantages
which
you
must
know
to
been
designed
for
him
you
deprived
best
years
his
life
that
independence
which
was
no
less
his
due
than
his
desert
you
done
yet
you
can
treat
mention
his
misfortune
with
contempt
ridicule
cried
darcy
as
he
walked
with
quick
steps
across
room
your
opinion
me
estimation
in
which
you
hold
me
thank
you
for
explaining
so
fully
my
faults
according
to
calculation
heavy
indeed
but
perhaps
added
he
stopping
in
his
walk
turning
towards
her
these
offenses
might
been
overlooked
had
not
your
pride
been
hurt
by
my
honest
confession
scruples
that
had
long
prevented
my
forming
any
serious
design
these
bitter
accusations
might
been
suppressed
had
with
greater
policy
concealed
my
struggles
flattered
you
into
belief
my
being
impelled
by
unqualified
unalloyed
inclination
by
reason
by
reflection
by
everything
but
disguise
every
sort
my
abhorrence
nor
ashamed
feelings
related
they
were
natural
just
could
you
expect
me
to
rejoice
in
inferiority
your
connections
to
congratulate
myself
on
hope
relations
whose
condition
in
life
so
decidedly
beneath
my
own
elizabeth
felt
herself
growing
more
angry
every
moment
yet
she
tried
to
utmost
to
speak
with
composure
when
she
said
you
mistaken
mr
darcy
if
you
suppose
that
mode
your
declaration
affected
me
in
any
other
way
than
as
spared
concern
which
might
felt
in
refusing
you
had
you
behaved
in
more
gentlemanlike
manner
she
saw
him
start
at
but
he
said
nothing
she
continued
you
could
not
made
offer
your
hand
in
any
possible
way
that
would
tempted
me
to
accept
again
his
astonishment
was
obvious
he
looked
at
her
with
an
expression
mingled
incredulity
mortification
she
went
on
from
very
beginning
from
first
moment
may
almost
say
my
acquaintance
with
you
your
manners
impressing
me
with
fullest
belief
your
arrogance
your
conceit
your
selfish
disdain
feelings
others
were
such
as
to
form
groundwork
disapprobation
on
which
succeeding
events
built
so
immovable
dislike
had
not
known
you
month
before
felt
that
you
were
last
man
in
world
whom
could
ever
be
prevailed
on
to
marry
you
said
quite
enough
madam
perfectly
comprehend
your
feelings
now
only
to
be
ashamed
what
my
own
been
forgive
me
for
having
taken
up
so
much
your
time
accept
my
best
wishes
for
your
health
happiness
with
these
words
he
hastily
left
room
elizabeth
heard
him
next
moment
open
front
door
quit
house
tumult
her
mind
was
now
painfully
great
she
knew
not
how
to
support
herself
from
actual
weakness
sat
down
cried
for
half
an
hour
her
astonishment
as
she
reflected
on
what
had
passed
was
increased
by
every
review
that
she
receive
an
offer
marriage
from
mr
darcy
that
he
been
in
love
with
her
for
so
many
months
so
much
in
love
as
to
wish
to
marry
her
in
spite
objections
which
had
made
him
prevent
his
friend
s
marrying
her
sister
which
must
appear
at
least
with
equal
force
in
his
own
case
was
almost
incredible
was
gratifying
to
inspired
unconsciously
so
strong
an
affection
but
his
pride
his
abominable
pride
his
shameless
avowal
what
he
had
done
with
respect
to
jane
his
unpardonable
assurance
in
acknowledging
though
he
could
not
justify
unfeeling
manner
in
which
he
had
mentioned
mr
wickham
his
cruelty
towards
whom
he
had
not
attempted
to
deny
soon
overcame
pity
which
consideration
his
attachment
had
for
moment
excited
she
continued
in
very
agitated
reflections
till
sound
lady
catherine
s
carriage
made
her
feel
how
unequal
she
was
to
encounter
charlotte
s
observation
hurried
her
away
to
her
room
chapter
elizabeth
awoke
next
morning
to
same
thoughts
meditations
which
had
at
length
closed
her
eyes
she
could
not
yet
recover
from
surprise
what
had
happened
was
impossible
to
think
anything
else
totally
indisposed
for
employment
she
resolved
soon
after
breakfast
to
indulge
herself
in
air
exercise
she
was
proceeding
directly
to
her
favourite
walk
when
recollection
mr
darcy
s
sometimes
coming
there
stopped
her
instead
entering
park
she
turned
up
lane
which
led
farther
from
turnpike
road
park
paling
was
still
boundary
on
one
side
she
soon
passed
one
gates
into
ground
after
walking
two
or
times
along
that
part
lane
she
was
tempted
by
pleasantness
morning
to
stop
at
gates
look
into
park
five
weeks
which
she
had
now
passed
in
kent
had
made
great
difference
in
country
every
day
was
adding
to
verdure
early
trees
she
was
on
point
continuing
her
walk
when
she
caught
glimpse
gentleman
within
sort
grove
which
edged
park
he
was
moving
that
way
fearful
its
being
mr
darcy
she
was
directly
retreating
but
person
who
advanced
was
now
near
enough
to
see
her
stepping
forward
with
eagerness
pronounced
her
name
she
had
turned
away
but
on
hearing
herself
called
though
in
voice
which
proved
to
be
mr
darcy
she
moved
again
towards
gate
he
had
by
that
time
reached
also
holding
out
letter
which
she
instinctively
took
said
with
look
haughty
composure
been
walking
in
grove
some
time
in
hope
meeting
you
will
you
do
me
honour
reading
that
letter
then
with
slight
bow
turned
again
into
plantation
was
soon
out
sight
with
no
expectation
pleasure
but
with
strongest
curiosity
elizabeth
opened
letter
to
her
still
increasing
wonder
perceived
an
envelope
containing
two
sheets
letter
paper
written
quite
through
in
very
close
hand
envelope
itself
was
likewise
full
pursuing
her
way
along
lane
she
then
began
was
dated
from
rosings
at
eight
o
clock
in
morning
was
as
follows
be
not
alarmed
madam
on
receiving
letter
by
apprehension
its
containing
any
repetition
those
sentiments
or
renewal
those
offers
which
were
last
night
so
disgusting
to
you
write
without
any
intention
paining
you
or
humbling
myself
by
dwelling
on
wishes
which
for
happiness
both
cannot
be
too
soon
forgotten
effort
which
formation
perusal
letter
must
occasion
been
spared
had
not
my
character
required
to
be
written
read
you
must
therefore
pardon
freedom
with
which
demand
your
attention
your
feelings
know
will
bestow
unwillingly
but
demand
your
justice
two
offenses
very
different
nature
by
no
means
equal
magnitude
you
last
night
laid
to
my
charge
first
mentioned
was
that
regardless
sentiments
either
had
detached
mr
bingley
from
your
sister
other
that
had
in
defiance
various
claims
in
defiance
honour
humanity
ruined
immediate
prosperity
blasted
prospects
mr
wickham
wilfully
wantonly
to
thrown
off
companion
my
youth
acknowledged
favourite
my
father
young
man
who
had
scarcely
any
other
dependence
than
on
our
patronage
who
had
been
brought
up
to
expect
its
exertion
would
be
depravity
to
which
separation
two
young
persons
whose
affection
could
be
growth
only
few
weeks
could
bear
no
comparison
but
from
severity
that
blame
which
was
last
night
so
liberally
bestowed
respecting
each
circumstance
shall
hope
to
be
in
future
secured
when
following
account
my
actions
their
motives
has
been
read
if
in
explanation
them
which
due
to
myself
under
necessity
relating
feelings
which
may
be
offensive
to
yours
can
only
say
that
sorry
necessity
must
be
obeyed
further
apology
would
be
absurd
had
not
been
long
in
hertfordshire
before
saw
in
common
with
others
that
bingley
preferred
your
elder
sister
to
any
other
young
woman
in
country
but
was
not
till
evening
dance
at
netherfield
that
had
any
apprehension
his
feeling
serious
attachment
had
often
seen
him
in
love
before
at
that
ball
while
had
honour
dancing
with
you
was
first
made
acquainted
by
sir
william
lucas
s
accidental
information
that
bingley
s
attentions
to
your
sister
had
given
rise
to
general
expectation
their
marriage
he
spoke
as
certain
event
which
time
alone
could
be
undecided
from
that
moment
observed
my
friend
s
behaviour
attentively
could
then
perceive
that
his
partiality
for
miss
bennet
was
beyond
what
had
ever
witnessed
in
him
your
sister
also
watched
her
look
manners
were
open
cheerful
engaging
as
ever
but
without
any
symptom
peculiar
regard
remained
convinced
from
evening
s
scrutiny
that
though
she
received
his
attentions
with
pleasure
she
did
not
invite
them
by
any
participation
sentiment
if
you
not
been
mistaken
here
must
been
in
error
your
superior
knowledge
your
sister
must
make
latter
probable
if
be
so
if
been
misled
by
such
error
to
inflict
pain
on
her
your
resentment
has
not
been
unreasonable
but
shall
not
scruple
to
assert
that
serenity
your
sister
s
countenance
air
was
such
as
might
given
most
acute
observer
conviction
that
however
amiable
her
temper
her
heart
was
not
likely
to
be
easily
touched
that
was
desirous
believing
her
indifferent
certain
but
will
venture
to
say
that
my
investigation
decisions
not
usually
influenced
by
my
hopes
or
fears
did
not
believe
her
to
be
indifferent
because
wished
believed
on
impartial
conviction
as
truly
as
wished
in
reason
my
objections
to
marriage
were
not
merely
those
which
last
night
acknowledged
to
utmost
force
passion
to
put
aside
in
my
own
case
want
connection
could
not
be
so
great
an
evil
to
my
friend
as
to
me
but
there
were
other
causes
repugnance
causes
which
though
still
existing
existing
to
an
equal
degree
in
both
instances
had
myself
endeavoured
to
forget
because
they
were
not
immediately
before
me
these
causes
must
be
stated
though
briefly
situation
your
mother
s
family
though
objectionable
was
nothing
in
comparison
to
that
total
want
propriety
so
frequently
so
almost
uniformly
betrayed
by
herself
by
your
younger
sisters
occasionally
even
by
your
father
pardon
me
pains
me
to
offend
you
but
amidst
your
concern
for
defects
your
nearest
relations
your
displeasure
at
representation
them
let
give
you
consolation
to
consider
that
to
conducted
yourselves
so
as
to
avoid
any
share
like
censure
praise
no
less
generally
bestowed
on
you
your
elder
sister
than
honourable
to
sense
disposition
both
will
only
say
farther
that
from
what
passed
that
evening
my
opinion
parties
was
confirmed
every
inducement
heightened
which
could
led
me
before
to
preserve
my
friend
from
what
esteemed
most
unhappy
connection
he
left
netherfield
for
london
on
day
following
as
you
certain
remember
with
design
soon
returning
part
which
acted
now
to
be
explained
his
sisters
uneasiness
had
been
equally
excited
with
my
own
our
coincidence
feeling
was
soon
discovered
alike
sensible
that
no
time
was
to
be
lost
in
detaching
their
brother
we
shortly
resolved
on
joining
him
directly
in
london
we
accordingly
went
there
readily
engaged
in
office
pointing
out
to
my
friend
certain
evils
such
choice
described
enforced
them
earnestly
but
however
remonstrance
might
staggered
or
delayed
his
determination
do
not
suppose
that
would
ultimately
prevented
marriage
had
not
been
seconded
by
assurance
that
hesitated
not
in
giving
your
sister
s
indifference
he
had
before
believed
her
to
return
his
affection
with
sincere
if
not
with
equal
regard
but
bingley
has
great
natural
modesty
with
stronger
dependence
on
my
judgement
than
on
his
own
to
convince
him
therefore
that
he
had
deceived
himself
was
no
very
difficult
point
to
persuade
him
against
returning
into
hertfordshire
when
that
conviction
had
been
given
was
scarcely
work
moment
cannot
blame
myself
for
having
done
thus
much
there
but
one
part
my
conduct
in
whole
affair
on
which
do
not
reflect
with
satisfaction
that
condescended
to
adopt
measures
art
so
far
as
to
conceal
from
him
your
sister
s
being
in
town
knew
myself
as
was
known
to
miss
bingley
but
her
brother
even
yet
ignorant
that
they
might
met
without
ill
consequence
perhaps
probable
but
his
regard
did
not
appear
to
me
enough
extinguished
for
him
to
see
her
without
some
danger
perhaps
concealment
disguise
was
beneath
me
done
however
was
done
for
best
on
subject
nothing
more
to
say
no
other
apology
to
offer
if
wounded
your
sister
s
feelings
was
unknowingly
done
though
motives
which
governed
me
may
to
you
very
naturally
appear
insufficient
not
yet
learnt
to
condemn
them
with
respect
to
that
other
more
weighty
accusation
having
injured
mr
wickham
can
only
refute
by
laying
before
you
whole
his
connection
with
my
family
what
he
has
particularly
accused
me
ignorant
but
truth
what
shall
relate
can
summon
more
than
one
witness
undoubted
veracity
mr
wickham
son
very
respectable
man
who
had
for
many
years
management
pemberley
estates
whose
good
conduct
in
discharge
his
trust
naturally
inclined
my
father
to
be
service
to
him
on
george
wickham
who
was
his
godson
his
kindness
was
therefore
liberally
bestowed
my
father
supported
him
at
school
afterwards
at
cambridge
most
important
assistance
as
his
own
father
always
poor
from
extravagance
his
wife
would
been
unable
to
give
him
gentleman
s
education
my
father
was
not
only
fond
young
man
s
society
whose
manner
were
always
engaging
he
had
also
highest
opinion
him
hoping
church
would
be
his
profession
intended
to
provide
for
him
in
as
for
myself
many
many
years
since
first
began
to
think
him
in
very
different
manner
vicious
propensities
want
principle
which
he
was
careful
to
guard
from
knowledge
his
best
friend
could
not
escape
observation
young
man
nearly
same
age
with
himself
who
had
opportunities
seeing
him
in
unguarded
moments
which
mr
darcy
could
not
here
again
shall
give
you
pain
to
what
degree
you
only
can
tell
but
whatever
may
be
sentiments
which
mr
wickham
has
created
suspicion
their
nature
shall
not
prevent
me
from
unfolding
his
real
character
adds
even
another
motive
my
excellent
father
died
about
five
years
ago
his
attachment
to
mr
wickham
was
to
last
so
steady
that
in
his
will
he
particularly
recommended
to
me
to
promote
his
advancement
in
best
manner
that
his
profession
might
allow
if
he
took
orders
desired
that
valuable
family
living
might
be
his
as
soon
as
became
vacant
there
was
also
legacy
one
thousand
pounds
his
own
father
did
not
long
survive
mine
within
half
year
from
these
events
mr
wickham
wrote
to
inform
me
that
having
finally
resolved
against
taking
orders
he
hoped
not
think
unreasonable
for
him
to
expect
some
more
immediate
pecuniary
advantage
in
lieu
preferment
by
which
he
could
not
be
benefited
he
had
some
intention
he
added
studying
law
must
be
aware
that
interest
one
thousand
pounds
would
be
very
insufficient
support
therein
rather
wished
than
believed
him
to
be
sincere
but
at
any
rate
was
perfectly
ready
to
accede
to
his
proposal
knew
that
mr
wickham
ought
not
to
be
clergyman
business
was
therefore
soon
settled
he
resigned
claim
to
assistance
in
church
were
possible
that
he
could
ever
be
in
situation
to
receive
accepted
in
return
thousand
pounds
connection
between
us
seemed
now
dissolved
thought
too
ill
him
to
invite
him
to
pemberley
or
admit
his
society
in
town
in
town
believe
he
chiefly
lived
but
his
studying
law
was
mere
pretence
being
now
from
restraint
his
life
was
life
idleness
dissipation
for
about
years
heard
little
him
but
on
decease
incumbent
living
which
had
been
designed
for
him
he
applied
to
me
again
by
letter
for
presentation
his
circumstances
he
assured
me
had
no
difficulty
in
believing
were
exceedingly
bad
he
had
found
law
most
unprofitable
study
was
now
absolutely
resolved
on
being
ordained
if
would
present
him
to
living
in
question
which
he
trusted
there
could
be
little
doubt
as
he
was
well
assured
that
had
no
other
person
to
provide
for
could
not
forgotten
my
revered
father
s
intentions
you
will
hardly
blame
me
for
refusing
to
comply
with
entreaty
or
for
resisting
every
repetition
to
his
resentment
was
in
proportion
to
distress
his
circumstances
he
was
doubtless
as
violent
in
his
abuse
me
to
others
as
in
his
reproaches
to
myself
after
period
every
appearance
acquaintance
was
dropped
how
he
lived
know
not
but
last
summer
he
was
again
most
painfully
obtruded
on
my
notice
must
now
mention
circumstance
which
would
wish
to
forget
myself
which
no
obligation
less
than
present
induce
me
to
unfold
to
any
human
being
having
said
thus
much
feel
no
doubt
your
secrecy
my
sister
who
more
than
ten
years
my
junior
was
left
to
guardianship
my
mother
s
nephew
colonel
fitzwilliam
myself
about
year
ago
she
was
taken
from
school
an
establishment
formed
for
her
in
london
last
summer
she
went
with
lady
who
presided
over
to
ramsgate
thither
also
went
mr
wickham
undoubtedly
by
design
for
there
proved
to
been
prior
acquaintance
between
him
mrs
younge
in
whose
character
we
were
most
unhappily
deceived
by
her
connivance
aid
he
so
far
recommended
himself
to
georgiana
whose
affectionate
heart
retained
strong
impression
his
kindness
to
her
as
child
that
she
was
persuaded
to
believe
herself
in
love
to
consent
to
an
elopement
she
was
then
but
fifteen
which
must
be
her
excuse
after
stating
her
imprudence
happy
to
add
that
owed
knowledge
to
herself
joined
them
unexpectedly
day
or
two
before
intended
elopement
then
georgiana
unable
to
support
idea
grieving
offending
brother
whom
she
almost
looked
up
to
as
father
acknowledged
whole
to
me
you
may
imagine
what
felt
how
acted
regard
for
my
sister
s
credit
feelings
prevented
any
public
exposure
but
wrote
to
mr
wickham
who
left
place
immediately
mrs
younge
was
course
removed
from
her
charge
mr
wickham
s
chief
object
was
unquestionably
my
sister
s
fortune
which
thirty
thousand
pounds
but
cannot
help
supposing
that
hope
revenging
himself
on
me
was
strong
inducement
his
revenge
would
been
complete
indeed
madam
faithful
narrative
every
event
in
which
we
been
concerned
together
if
you
do
not
absolutely
reject
as
false
you
will
hope
acquit
me
henceforth
cruelty
towards
mr
wickham
know
not
in
what
manner
under
what
form
falsehood
he
had
imposed
on
you
but
his
success
not
perhaps
to
be
wondered
at
ignorant
as
you
previously
were
everything
concerning
either
detection
could
not
be
in
your
power
suspicion
certainly
not
in
your
inclination
you
may
possibly
wonder
why
was
not
told
you
last
night
but
was
not
then
master
enough
myself
to
know
what
could
or
ought
to
be
revealed
for
truth
everything
here
related
can
appeal
more
particularly
to
testimony
colonel
fitzwilliam
who
from
our
near
relationship
constant
intimacy
still
more
as
one
executors
my
father
s
will
has
been
unavoidably
acquainted
with
every
particular
these
transactions
if
your
abhorrence
me
make
my
assertions
valueless
you
cannot
be
prevented
by
same
cause
from
confiding
in
my
cousin
that
there
may
be
possibility
consulting
him
shall
endeavour
to
find
some
opportunity
putting
letter
in
your
hands
in
course
morning
will
only
add
god
bless
you
fitzwilliam
darcy
chapter
if
elizabeth
when
mr
darcy
gave
her
letter
did
not
expect
to
contain
renewal
his
offers
she
had
formed
no
expectation
at
its
contents
but
such
as
they
were
may
well
be
supposed
how
eagerly
she
went
through
them
what
contrariety
emotion
they
excited
her
feelings
as
she
read
were
scarcely
to
be
defined
with
amazement
did
she
first
understand
that
he
believed
any
apology
to
be
in
his
power
steadfastly
was
she
persuaded
that
he
could
no
explanation
to
give
which
just
sense
shame
would
not
conceal
with
strong
prejudice
against
everything
he
might
say
she
began
his
account
what
had
happened
at
netherfield
she
read
with
an
eagerness
which
hardly
left
her
power
comprehension
from
impatience
knowing
what
next
sentence
might
bring
was
incapable
attending
to
sense
one
before
her
eyes
his
belief
her
sister
s
insensibility
she
instantly
resolved
to
be
false
his
account
real
worst
objections
to
match
made
her
too
angry
to
any
wish
doing
him
justice
he
expressed
no
regret
for
what
he
had
done
which
satisfied
her
his
style
was
not
penitent
but
haughty
was
pride
insolence
but
when
subject
was
succeeded
by
his
account
mr
wickham
when
she
read
with
somewhat
clearer
attention
relation
events
which
if
true
must
overthrow
every
cherished
opinion
his
worth
which
bore
so
alarming
an
affinity
to
his
own
history
himself
her
feelings
were
yet
more
acutely
painful
more
difficult
definition
astonishment
apprehension
even
horror
oppressed
her
she
wished
to
discredit
entirely
repeatedly
exclaiming
must
be
false
cannot
be
must
be
grossest
falsehood
when
she
had
gone
through
whole
letter
though
scarcely
knowing
anything
last
page
or
two
put
hastily
away
protesting
that
she
would
not
regard
that
she
would
never
look
in
again
in
perturbed
state
mind
with
thoughts
that
could
rest
on
nothing
she
walked
on
but
would
not
do
in
half
minute
letter
was
unfolded
again
collecting
herself
as
well
as
she
could
she
again
began
mortifying
perusal
that
related
to
wickham
commanded
herself
so
far
as
to
examine
meaning
every
sentence
account
his
connection
with
pemberley
family
was
exactly
what
he
had
related
himself
kindness
late
mr
darcy
though
she
had
not
before
known
its
extent
agreed
equally
well
with
his
own
words
so
far
each
recital
confirmed
other
but
when
she
came
to
will
difference
was
great
what
wickham
had
said
living
was
fresh
in
her
memory
as
she
recalled
his
very
words
was
impossible
not
to
feel
that
there
was
gross
duplicity
on
one
side
or
other
for
few
moments
she
flattered
herself
that
her
wishes
did
not
err
but
when
she
read
re
read
with
closest
attention
particulars
immediately
following
wickham
s
resigning
pretensions
to
living
his
receiving
in
lieu
so
considerable
sum
as
thousand
pounds
again
was
she
forced
to
hesitate
she
put
down
letter
weighed
every
circumstance
with
what
she
meant
to
be
impartiality
deliberated
on
probability
each
statement
but
with
little
success
on
both
sides
was
only
assertion
again
she
read
on
but
every
line
proved
more
clearly
that
affair
which
she
had
believed
impossible
that
any
contrivance
could
so
represent
as
to
render
mr
darcy
s
conduct
in
less
than
infamous
was
capable
turn
which
must
make
him
entirely
blameless
throughout
whole
extravagance
general
profligacy
which
he
scrupled
not
to
lay
at
mr
wickham
s
charge
exceedingly
shocked
her
more
so
as
she
could
bring
no
proof
its
injustice
she
had
never
heard
him
before
his
entrance
into
shire
militia
in
which
he
had
engaged
at
persuasion
young
man
who
on
meeting
him
accidentally
in
town
had
there
renewed
slight
acquaintance
his
former
way
life
nothing
had
been
known
in
hertfordshire
but
what
he
told
himself
as
to
his
real
character
had
information
been
in
her
power
she
had
never
felt
wish
inquiring
his
countenance
voice
manner
had
established
him
at
once
in
possession
every
virtue
she
tried
to
recollect
some
instance
goodness
some
distinguished
trait
integrity
or
benevolence
that
might
rescue
him
from
attacks
mr
darcy
or
at
least
by
predominance
virtue
atone
for
those
casual
errors
under
which
she
would
endeavour
to
class
what
mr
darcy
had
described
as
idleness
vice
many
years
continuance
but
no
such
recollection
befriended
her
she
could
see
him
instantly
before
her
in
every
charm
air
address
but
she
could
remember
no
more
substantial
good
than
general
approbation
neighbourhood
regard
which
his
social
powers
had
gained
him
in
mess
after
pausing
on
point
considerable
while
she
once
more
continued
to
read
but
alas
story
which
followed
his
designs
on
miss
darcy
received
some
confirmation
from
what
had
passed
between
colonel
fitzwilliam
herself
only
morning
before
at
last
she
was
referred
for
truth
every
particular
to
colonel
fitzwilliam
himself
from
whom
she
had
previously
received
information
his
near
concern
in
his
cousin
s
affairs
whose
character
she
had
no
reason
to
question
at
one
time
she
had
almost
resolved
on
applying
to
him
but
idea
was
checked
by
awkwardness
application
at
length
wholly
banished
by
conviction
that
mr
darcy
would
never
hazarded
such
proposal
if
he
had
not
been
well
assured
his
cousin
s
corroboration
she
perfectly
remembered
everything
that
had
passed
in
conversation
between
wickham
herself
in
their
first
evening
at
mr
phillips
s
many
his
expressions
were
still
fresh
in
her
memory
she
was
now
struck
with
impropriety
such
communications
to
stranger
wondered
had
escaped
her
before
she
saw
indelicacy
putting
himself
forward
as
he
had
done
inconsistency
his
professions
with
his
conduct
she
remembered
that
he
had
boasted
having
no
fear
seeing
mr
darcy
that
mr
darcy
might
leave
country
but
that
he
stand
his
ground
yet
he
had
avoided
netherfield
ball
very
next
week
she
remembered
also
that
till
netherfield
family
had
quitted
country
he
had
told
his
story
to
no
one
but
herself
but
that
after
their
removal
had
been
everywhere
discussed
that
he
had
then
no
reserves
no
scruples
in
sinking
mr
darcy
s
character
though
he
had
assured
her
that
respect
for
father
would
always
prevent
his
exposing
son
how
differently
did
everything
now
appear
in
which
he
was
concerned
his
attentions
to
miss
king
were
now
consequence
views
solely
hatefully
mercenary
mediocrity
her
fortune
proved
no
longer
moderation
his
wishes
but
his
eagerness
to
grasp
at
anything
his
behaviour
to
herself
could
now
had
no
tolerable
motive
he
had
either
been
deceived
with
regard
to
her
fortune
or
had
been
gratifying
his
vanity
by
encouraging
preference
which
she
believed
she
had
most
incautiously
shown
every
lingering
struggle
in
his
favour
grew
fainter
fainter
in
farther
justification
mr
darcy
she
could
not
but
allow
mr
bingley
when
questioned
by
jane
had
long
ago
asserted
his
blamelessness
in
affair
that
proud
repulsive
as
were
his
manners
she
had
never
in
whole
course
their
acquaintance
an
acquaintance
which
had
latterly
brought
them
much
together
given
her
sort
intimacy
with
his
ways
seen
anything
that
betrayed
him
to
be
unprincipled
or
unjust
anything
that
spoke
him
irreligious
or
immoral
habits
that
among
his
own
connections
he
was
esteemed
valued
that
even
wickham
had
allowed
him
merit
as
brother
that
she
had
often
heard
him
speak
so
affectionately
his
sister
as
to
prove
him
capable
some
amiable
feeling
that
had
his
actions
been
what
mr
wickham
represented
them
so
gross
violation
everything
right
could
hardly
been
concealed
from
world
that
friendship
between
person
capable
such
an
amiable
man
as
mr
bingley
was
incomprehensible
she
grew
absolutely
ashamed
herself
neither
darcy
nor
wickham
could
she
think
without
feeling
she
had
been
blind
partial
prejudiced
absurd
how
despicably
acted
she
cried
who
prided
myself
on
my
discernment
who
valued
myself
on
my
abilities
who
often
disdained
generous
candour
my
sister
gratified
my
vanity
in
useless
or
blameable
mistrust
how
humiliating
discovery
yet
how
just
humiliation
had
been
in
love
could
not
been
more
wretchedly
blind
but
vanity
not
love
has
been
my
folly
pleased
with
preference
one
offended
by
neglect
other
on
very
beginning
our
acquaintance
courted
prepossession
ignorance
driven
reason
away
where
either
were
concerned
till
moment
never
knew
myself
from
herself
to
jane
from
jane
to
bingley
her
thoughts
were
in
line
which
soon
brought
to
her
recollection
that
mr
darcy
s
explanation
there
had
appeared
very
insufficient
she
read
again
widely
different
was
effect
perusal
how
could
she
deny
that
credit
to
his
assertions
in
one
instance
which
she
had
been
obliged
to
give
in
other
he
declared
himself
to
be
totally
unsuspicious
her
sister
s
attachment
she
could
not
help
remembering
what
charlotte
s
opinion
had
always
been
neither
could
she
deny
justice
his
description
jane
she
felt
that
jane
s
feelings
though
fervent
were
little
displayed
that
there
was
constant
complacency
in
her
air
manner
not
often
united
with
great
sensibility
when
she
came
to
that
part
letter
in
which
her
family
were
mentioned
in
terms
such
mortifying
yet
merited
reproach
her
sense
shame
was
severe
justice
charge
struck
her
too
forcibly
for
denial
circumstances
to
which
he
particularly
alluded
as
having
passed
at
netherfield
ball
as
confirming
his
first
disapprobation
could
not
made
stronger
impression
on
his
mind
than
on
hers
compliment
to
herself
her
sister
was
not
unfelt
soothed
but
could
not
console
her
for
contempt
which
had
thus
been
self
attracted
by
rest
her
family
as
she
considered
that
jane
s
disappointment
had
in
fact
been
work
her
nearest
relations
reflected
how
materially
credit
both
must
be
hurt
by
such
impropriety
conduct
she
felt
depressed
beyond
anything
she
had
ever
known
before
after
wandering
along
lane
for
two
hours
giving
way
to
every
variety
thought
re
considering
events
determining
probabilities
reconciling
herself
as
well
as
she
could
to
change
so
sudden
so
important
fatigue
recollection
her
long
absence
made
her
at
length
return
home
she
entered
house
with
wish
appearing
cheerful
as
usual
resolution
repressing
such
reflections
as
must
make
her
unfit
for
conversation
she
was
immediately
told
that
two
gentlemen
from
rosings
had
each
called
during
her
absence
mr
darcy
only
for
few
minutes
to
take
leave
but
that
colonel
fitzwilliam
had
been
sitting
with
them
at
least
an
hour
hoping
for
her
return
almost
resolving
to
walk
after
her
till
she
could
be
found
elizabeth
could
but
just
affect
concern
in
missing
him
she
really
rejoiced
at
colonel
fitzwilliam
was
no
longer
an
object
she
could
think
only
her
letter
chapter
two
gentlemen
left
rosings
next
morning
mr
collins
having
been
in
waiting
near
lodges
to
make
them
his
parting
obeisance
was
able
to
bring
home
pleasing
intelligence
their
appearing
in
very
good
health
in
as
tolerable
spirits
as
could
be
expected
after
melancholy
scene
so
lately
gone
through
at
rosings
to
rosings
he
then
hastened
to
console
lady
catherine
her
daughter
on
his
return
brought
back
with
great
satisfaction
message
from
her
ladyship
importing
that
she
felt
herself
so
dull
as
to
make
her
very
desirous
having
them
to
dine
with
her
elizabeth
could
not
see
lady
catherine
without
recollecting
that
had
she
chosen
she
might
by
time
been
presented
to
her
as
her
future
niece
nor
could
she
think
without
smile
what
her
ladyship
s
indignation
would
been
what
would
she
said
how
would
she
behaved
were
questions
with
which
she
amused
herself
their
first
subject
was
diminution
rosings
party
assure
you
feel
exceedingly
said
lady
catherine
believe
no
one
feels
loss
friends
so
much
as
do
but
particularly
attached
to
these
young
men
know
them
to
be
so
much
attached
to
me
they
were
excessively
sorry
to
go
but
so
they
always
dear
colonel
rallied
his
spirits
tolerably
till
just
at
last
but
darcy
seemed
to
feel
most
acutely
more
think
than
last
year
his
attachment
to
rosings
certainly
increases
mr
collins
had
compliment
an
allusion
to
throw
in
here
which
were
kindly
smiled
on
by
mother
daughter
lady
catherine
observed
after
dinner
that
miss
bennet
seemed
out
spirits
immediately
accounting
for
by
herself
by
supposing
that
she
did
not
like
to
go
home
again
so
soon
she
added
but
if
that
case
you
must
write
to
your
mother
beg
that
you
may
stay
little
longer
mrs
collins
will
be
very
glad
your
company
sure
much
obliged
to
your
ladyship
for
your
kind
invitation
replied
elizabeth
but
not
in
my
power
to
accept
must
be
in
town
next
saturday
why
at
that
rate
you
will
been
here
only
six
weeks
expected
you
to
stay
two
months
told
mrs
collins
so
before
you
came
there
can
be
no
occasion
for
your
going
so
soon
mrs
bennet
could
certainly
spare
you
for
another
fortnight
but
my
father
cannot
he
wrote
last
week
to
hurry
my
return
oh
your
father
course
may
spare
you
if
your
mother
can
daughters
never
so
much
consequence
to
father
if
you
will
stay
another
month
complete
will
be
in
my
power
to
take
one
you
as
far
as
london
for
going
there
early
in
june
for
week
as
dawson
does
not
object
to
barouche
box
there
will
be
very
good
room
for
one
you
indeed
if
weather
happen
to
be
cool
not
object
to
taking
you
both
as
you
neither
you
large
you
kindness
madam
but
believe
we
must
abide
by
our
original
plan
lady
catherine
seemed
resigned
mrs
collins
you
must
send
servant
with
them
you
know
always
speak
my
mind
cannot
bear
idea
two
young
women
travelling
post
by
themselves
highly
improper
you
must
contrive
to
send
somebody
greatest
dislike
in
world
to
that
sort
thing
young
women
always
be
properly
guarded
attended
according
to
their
situation
in
life
when
my
niece
georgiana
went
to
ramsgate
last
summer
made
point
her
having
two
men
servants
go
with
her
miss
darcy
daughter
mr
darcy
pemberley
lady
anne
could
not
appeared
with
propriety
in
different
manner
excessively
attentive
to
those
things
you
must
send
john
with
young
ladies
mrs
collins
glad
occurred
to
me
to
mention
for
would
really
be
discreditable
to
you
to
let
them
go
alone
my
uncle
to
send
servant
for
us
oh
your
uncle
he
keeps
man
servant
does
he
very
glad
you
somebody
who
thinks
these
things
where
shall
you
change
horses
oh
bromley
course
if
you
mention
my
name
at
bell
you
will
be
attended
to
lady
catherine
had
many
other
questions
to
ask
respecting
their
journey
as
she
did
not
answer
them
herself
attention
was
necessary
which
elizabeth
believed
to
be
lucky
for
her
or
with
mind
so
occupied
she
might
forgotten
where
she
was
reflection
must
be
reserved
for
solitary
hours
whenever
she
was
alone
she
gave
way
to
as
greatest
relief
not
day
went
by
without
solitary
walk
in
which
she
might
indulge
in
delight
unpleasant
recollections
mr
darcy
s
letter
she
was
in
fair
way
soon
knowing
by
heart
she
studied
every
sentence
her
feelings
towards
its
writer
were
at
times
widely
different
when
she
remembered
style
his
address
she
was
still
full
indignation
but
when
she
considered
how
unjustly
she
had
condemned
upbraided
him
her
anger
was
turned
against
herself
his
disappointed
feelings
became
object
compassion
his
attachment
excited
gratitude
his
general
character
respect
but
she
could
not
approve
him
nor
could
she
for
moment
repent
her
refusal
or
feel
slightest
inclination
ever
to
see
him
again
in
her
own
past
behaviour
there
was
constant
source
vexation
regret
in
unhappy
defects
her
family
subject
yet
heavier
chagrin
they
were
hopeless
remedy
her
father
contented
with
laughing
at
them
would
never
exert
himself
to
restrain
wild
giddiness
his
youngest
daughters
her
mother
with
manners
so
far
from
right
herself
was
entirely
insensible
evil
elizabeth
had
frequently
united
with
jane
in
an
endeavour
to
check
imprudence
catherine
lydia
but
while
they
were
supported
by
their
mother
s
indulgence
what
chance
could
there
be
improvement
catherine
weak
spirited
irritable
completely
under
lydia
s
guidance
had
been
always
affronted
by
their
advice
lydia
self
willed
careless
would
scarcely
give
them
hearing
they
were
ignorant
idle
vain
while
there
was
an
officer
in
meryton
they
would
flirt
with
him
while
meryton
was
within
walk
longbourn
they
would
be
going
there
forever
anxiety
on
jane
s
behalf
was
another
prevailing
concern
mr
darcy
s
explanation
by
restoring
bingley
to
her
former
good
opinion
heightened
sense
what
jane
had
lost
his
affection
was
proved
to
been
sincere
his
conduct
cleared
blame
unless
any
could
attach
to
implicitness
his
confidence
in
his
friend
how
grievous
then
was
thought
that
situation
so
desirable
in
every
respect
so
replete
with
advantage
so
promising
for
happiness
jane
had
been
deprived
by
folly
indecorum
her
own
family
when
to
these
recollections
was
added
development
wickham
s
character
may
be
easily
believed
that
happy
spirits
which
had
seldom
been
depressed
before
were
now
so
much
affected
as
to
make
almost
impossible
for
her
to
appear
tolerably
cheerful
their
engagements
at
rosings
were
as
frequent
during
last
week
her
stay
as
they
had
been
at
first
very
last
evening
was
spent
there
her
ladyship
again
inquired
minutely
into
particulars
their
journey
gave
them
directions
as
to
best
method
packing
was
so
urgent
on
necessity
placing
gowns
in
only
right
way
that
maria
thought
herself
obliged
on
her
return
to
undo
work
morning
pack
her
trunk
afresh
when
they
parted
lady
catherine
with
great
condescension
wished
them
good
journey
invited
them
to
come
to
hunsford
again
next
year
miss
de
bourgh
exerted
herself
so
far
as
to
curtsey
hold
out
her
hand
to
both
chapter
on
saturday
morning
elizabeth
mr
collins
met
for
breakfast
few
minutes
before
others
appeared
he
took
opportunity
paying
parting
civilities
which
he
deemed
indispensably
necessary
know
not
miss
elizabeth
said
he
whether
mrs
collins
has
yet
expressed
her
sense
your
kindness
in
coming
to
us
but
very
certain
you
will
not
leave
house
without
receiving
her
thanks
for
favor
your
company
has
been
much
felt
assure
you
we
know
how
little
there
to
tempt
anyone
to
our
humble
abode
our
plain
manner
living
our
small
rooms
few
domestics
little
we
see
world
must
make
hunsford
extremely
dull
to
young
lady
like
yourself
but
hope
you
will
believe
us
grateful
for
condescension
that
we
done
everything
in
our
power
to
prevent
your
spending
your
time
unpleasantly
elizabeth
was
eager
with
her
thanks
assurances
happiness
she
had
spent
six
weeks
with
great
enjoyment
pleasure
being
with
charlotte
kind
attentions
she
had
received
must
make
her
feel
obliged
mr
collins
was
gratified
with
more
smiling
solemnity
replied
gives
me
great
pleasure
to
hear
that
you
passed
your
time
not
disagreeably
we
certainly
done
our
best
most
fortunately
having
in
our
power
to
introduce
you
to
very
superior
society
from
our
connection
with
rosings
frequent
means
varying
humble
home
scene
think
we
may
flatter
ourselves
that
your
hunsford
visit
cannot
been
entirely
irksome
our
situation
with
regard
to
lady
catherine
s
family
indeed
sort
extraordinary
advantage
blessing
which
few
can
boast
you
see
on
what
footing
we
you
see
how
continually
we
engaged
there
in
truth
must
acknowledge
that
with
disadvantages
humble
parsonage
not
think
anyone
abiding
in
an
object
compassion
while
they
sharers
our
intimacy
at
rosings
words
were
insufficient
for
elevation
his
feelings
he
was
obliged
to
walk
about
room
while
elizabeth
tried
to
unite
civility
truth
in
few
short
sentences
you
may
in
fact
carry
very
favourable
report
us
into
hertfordshire
my
dear
cousin
flatter
myself
at
least
that
you
will
be
able
to
do
so
lady
catherine
s
great
attentions
to
mrs
collins
you
been
daily
witness
altogether
trust
does
not
appear
that
your
friend
has
drawn
an
unfortunate
but
on
point
will
be
as
well
to
be
silent
only
let
me
assure
you
my
dear
miss
elizabeth
that
can
from
my
heart
most
cordially
wish
you
equal
felicity
in
marriage
my
dear
charlotte
but
one
mind
one
way
thinking
there
in
everything
most
remarkable
resemblance
character
ideas
between
us
we
seem
to
been
designed
for
each
other
elizabeth
could
safely
say
that
was
great
happiness
where
that
was
case
with
equal
sincerity
could
add
that
she
firmly
believed
rejoiced
in
his
domestic
comforts
she
was
not
sorry
however
to
recital
them
interrupted
by
lady
from
whom
they
sprang
poor
charlotte
was
melancholy
to
leave
her
to
such
society
but
she
had
chosen
with
her
eyes
open
though
evidently
regretting
that
her
visitors
were
to
go
she
did
not
seem
to
ask
for
compassion
her
home
her
housekeeping
her
parish
her
poultry
their
dependent
concerns
had
not
yet
lost
their
charms
at
length
chaise
arrived
trunks
were
fastened
on
parcels
placed
within
was
pronounced
to
be
ready
after
an
affectionate
parting
between
friends
elizabeth
was
attended
to
carriage
by
mr
collins
as
they
walked
down
garden
he
was
commissioning
her
with
his
best
respects
to
her
family
not
forgetting
his
thanks
for
kindness
he
had
received
at
longbourn
in
winter
his
compliments
to
mr
mrs
gardiner
though
unknown
he
then
handed
her
in
maria
followed
door
was
on
point
being
closed
when
he
suddenly
reminded
them
with
some
consternation
that
they
had
hitherto
forgotten
to
leave
any
message
for
ladies
at
rosings
but
he
added
you
will
course
wish
to
your
humble
respects
delivered
to
them
with
your
grateful
thanks
for
their
kindness
to
you
while
you
been
here
elizabeth
made
no
objection
door
was
then
allowed
to
be
shut
carriage
drove
off
good
gracious
cried
maria
after
few
minutes
silence
seems
but
day
or
two
since
we
first
came
yet
how
many
things
happened
great
many
indeed
said
her
companion
with
sigh
we
dined
nine
times
at
rosings
besides
drinking
tea
there
twice
how
much
shall
to
tell
elizabeth
added
privately
how
much
shall
to
conceal
their
journey
was
performed
without
much
conversation
or
any
alarm
within
four
hours
their
leaving
hunsford
they
reached
mr
gardiner
s
house
where
they
were
to
remain
few
days
jane
looked
well
elizabeth
had
little
opportunity
studying
her
spirits
amidst
various
engagements
which
kindness
her
aunt
had
reserved
for
them
but
jane
was
to
go
home
with
her
at
longbourn
there
would
be
leisure
enough
for
observation
was
not
without
an
effort
meanwhile
that
she
could
wait
even
for
longbourn
before
she
told
her
sister
mr
darcy
s
proposals
to
know
that
she
had
power
revealing
what
would
so
exceedingly
astonish
jane
must
at
same
time
so
highly
gratify
whatever
her
own
vanity
she
had
not
yet
been
able
to
reason
away
was
such
temptation
to
openness
as
nothing
could
conquered
but
state
indecision
in
which
she
remained
as
to
extent
what
she
communicate
her
fear
if
she
once
entered
on
subject
being
hurried
into
repeating
something
bingley
which
might
only
grieve
her
sister
further
chapter
was
week
in
may
in
which
young
ladies
set
out
together
from
gracechurch
street
for
town
in
hertfordshire
as
they
drew
near
appointed
inn
where
mr
bennet
s
carriage
was
to
meet
them
they
quickly
perceived
in
token
coachman
s
punctuality
both
kitty
lydia
looking
out
dining
room
upstairs
these
two
girls
had
been
above
an
hour
in
place
happily
employed
in
visiting
an
opposite
milliner
watching
sentinel
on
guard
dressing
salad
cucumber
after
welcoming
their
sisters
they
triumphantly
displayed
table
set
out
with
such
cold
meat
as
an
inn
larder
usually
affords
exclaiming
not
nice
not
an
agreeable
surprise
we
mean
to
treat
you
added
lydia
but
you
must
lend
us
money
for
we
just
spent
ours
at
shop
out
there
then
showing
her
purchases
look
here
bought
bonnet
do
not
think
very
pretty
but
thought
might
as
well
buy
as
not
shall
pull
to
pieces
as
soon
as
get
home
see
if
can
make
up
any
better
when
her
sisters
abused
as
ugly
she
added
with
perfect
unconcern
oh
but
there
were
two
or
much
uglier
in
shop
when
bought
some
prettier
coloured
satin
to
trim
with
fresh
think
will
be
very
tolerable
besides
will
not
much
signify
what
one
wears
summer
after
shire
left
meryton

in
fortnight

indeed
cried
elizabeth
with
greatest
satisfaction
they
going
to
be
encamped
near
brighton
do
so
want
papa
to
take
us
there
for
summer
would
be
such
delicious
scheme

say
would
hardly
cost
anything
at
mamma
would
like
to
go
too
things
only
think
what
miserable
summer
else

elizabeth
that

be
delightful
scheme
indeed
completely
do
for
us
at
once
good
heaven
brighton
whole
campful
soldiers

us

news
about
certain
person

at
each
other
waiter
was
told
he
need
not
stay
lydia
laughed
said
aye
that
just
like
your
formality
discretion
you
thought
waiter
must
not
hear
as
if
he
cared
dare
say
he
often
hears
worse
things
said
than
going
to
say
but
he
an
ugly
fellow
glad
he
gone
never
saw
such
long
chin

my
life

elizabeth
safe

imprudent
as
to
fortune
she
great
fool
for

if
she
liked
him
but
hope
there
no
strong
attachment
on
either
side
said
jane
sure
there
not
on
his
will
answer
for
he
never
cared
straws
about
her
who
could
about
such
nasty
little
freckled
thing
elizabeth
was
shocked
to
think
that
however
incapable
such
coarseness
expression
herself
coarseness
sentiment
was
little
other
than
her
own
breast
had
harboured
fancied
liberal
as
soon
as
had
ate
elder
ones
paid
carriage
was
ordered
after
some
contrivance
whole
party
with
their
boxes
work
bags
parcels
unwelcome
addition
kitty
s
lydia
s
purchases
were
seated
in
how
nicely
we
crammed
in
cried
lydia
glad

my
bonnet
if
only
for
fun
having
another
bandbox
well
now

us
be
quite
comfortable
snug
talk
laugh
way

in
first
place
let
us
hear
what
has
happened
to
you
since
you
went
away
you
seen
any
pleasant
men
you
had
any
flirting
was
in
great
hopes
that
one
you
would
got
husband
before
you
came
back
jane
will
be
quite
an
old
maid
soon
declare
she
almost
twenty
lord
how
ashamed
be
not
being
married
before
twenty
my
aunt
phillips
wants
you
so
to
get
husbands
you
can
t
think
she
says
lizzy
had
better
taken
mr
collins
but
do
not
think
there
would
been
any
fun
in
lord
how
like
to
be
married
before
any
you
then
would
chaperon
you
about
to
balls
dear
me
we
had
such
good
piece
fun
other
day
at
colonel
forster
s
kitty
me
were
to
spend
day
there
mrs
forster
promised
to
little
dance
in
evening
by
bye
mrs
forster
me
such
friends
so
she
asked
two
harringtons
to
come
but
harriet
was
ill
so
pen
was
forced
to
come
by
herself
then
what
do
you
think
we
did
we
dressed
up
chamberlayne
in
woman
s
clothes
on
purpose
to
pass
for
lady
only
think
what
fun
not
soul
knew
but
colonel
mrs
forster
kitty
me
except
my
aunt
for
we
were
forced
to
borrow
one
her
gowns
you
cannot
imagine
how
well
he
looked
when
denny
wickham
pratt
two
or
more
men
came
in
they
did
not
know
him
in
least
lord
how
laughed
so
did
mrs
forster
thought
died
that
made
men
suspect
something
then
they
soon
found
out
what
was
matter
with
such
kinds
histories
their
parties
good
jokes
did
lydia
assisted
by
kitty
s
hints
additions
endeavour
to
amuse
her
companions
way
to
longbourn
elizabeth
listened
as
little
as
she
could
but
there
was
no
escaping
frequent
mention
wickham
s
name
their
reception
at
home
was
most
kind
mrs
bennet
rejoiced
to
see
jane
in
undiminished
beauty
more
than
once
during
dinner
did
mr
bennet
say
voluntarily
to
elizabeth
glad
you
come
back
lizzy
their
party
in
dining
room
was
large
for
almost
lucases
came
to
meet
maria
hear
news
various
were
subjects
that
occupied
them
lady
lucas
was
inquiring
maria
after
welfare
poultry
her
eldest
daughter
mrs
bennet
was
doubly
engaged
on
one
hand
collecting
an
account
present
fashions
from
jane
who
sat
some
way
below
her
on
other
retailing
them
to
younger
lucases
lydia
in
voice
rather
louder
than
any
other
person
s
was
enumerating
various
pleasures
morning
to
anybody
who
would
hear
her
oh
mary
said
she
wish
you
had
gone
with
us
for
we
had
such
fun
as
we
went
along
kitty
drew
up
blinds
pretended
there
was
nobody
in
coach
gone
so
way
if
kitty
had
not
been
sick
when
we
got
to
george
do
think
we
behaved
very
handsomely
for
we
treated
other
with
nicest
cold
luncheon
in
world
if
you
would
gone
we
would
treated
you
too
then
when
we
came
away
was
such
fun
thought
we
never
got
into
coach
was
ready
to
die
laughter
then
we
were
so
merry
way
home
we
talked
laughed
so
loud
that
anybody
might
heard
us
ten
miles
off
to
mary
very
gravely
replied
far
be
from
me
my
dear
sister
to
depreciate
such
pleasures
they
would
doubtless
be
congenial
with
generality
female
minds
but
confess
they
would
no
charms
for
me
infinitely
prefer
book
but
answer
lydia
heard
not
word
she
seldom
listened
to
anybody
for
more
than
half
minute
never
attended
to
mary
at
in
afternoon
lydia
was
urgent
with
rest
girls
to
walk
to
meryton
to
see
how
everybody
went
on
but
elizabeth
steadily
opposed
scheme
not
be
said
that
miss
bennets
could
not
be
at
home
half
day
before
they
were
in
pursuit
officers
there
was
another
reason
too
for
her
opposition
she
dreaded
seeing
mr
wickham
again
was
resolved
to
avoid
as
long
as
possible
comfort
to
her
regiment
s
approaching
removal
was
indeed
beyond
expression
in
fortnight
they
were
to
go
once
gone
she
hoped
there
could
be
nothing
more
to
plague
her
on
his
account
she
had
not
been
many
hours
at
home
before
she
found
that
brighton
scheme
which
lydia
had
given
them
hint
at
inn
was
under
frequent
discussion
between
her
parents
elizabeth
saw
directly
that
her
father
had
not
smallest
intention
yielding
but
his
answers
were
at
same
time
so
vague
equivocal
that
her
mother
though
often
disheartened
had
never
yet
despaired
succeeding
at
last
chapter
elizabeth
s
impatience
to
acquaint
jane
with
what
had
happened
could
no
longer
be
overcome
at
length
resolving
to
suppress
every
particular
in
which
her
sister
was
concerned
preparing
her
to
be
surprised
she
related
to
her
next
morning
chief
scene
between
mr
darcy
herself
miss
bennet
s
astonishment
was
soon
lessened
by
strong
sisterly
partiality
which
made
any
admiration
elizabeth
appear
perfectly
natural
surprise
was
shortly
lost
in
other
feelings
she
was
sorry
that
mr
darcy
delivered
his
sentiments
in
manner
so
little
suited
to
recommend
them
but
still
more
was
she
grieved
for
unhappiness
which
her
sister
s
refusal
must
given
him
his
being
so
sure
succeeding
was
wrong
said
she
certainly
ought
not
to
appeared
but
consider
how
much
must
increase
his
disappointment
indeed
replied
elizabeth
heartily
sorry
for
him
but
he
has
other
feelings
which
will
probably
soon
drive
away
his
regard
for
me
you
do
not
blame
me
however
for
refusing
him
blame
you
oh
no
but
you
blame
me
for
having
spoken
so
warmly
wickham
no
do
not
know
that
you
were
wrong
in
saying
what
you
did
but
you
will
know
when
tell
you
what
happened
very
next
day
she
then
spoke
letter
repeating
whole
its
contents
as
far
as
they
concerned
george
wickham
what
stroke
was
for
poor
jane
who
would
willingly
gone
through
world
without
believing
that
so
much
wickedness
existed
in
whole
race
mankind
as
was
here
collected
in
one
individual
nor
was
darcy
s
vindication
though
grateful
to
her
feelings
capable
consoling
her
for
such
discovery
most
earnestly
did
she
labour
to
prove
probability
error
seek
to
clear
one
without
involving
other
will
not
do
said
elizabeth
you
never
will
be
able
to
make
both
them
good
for
anything
take
your
choice
but
you
must
be
satisfied
with
only
one
there
but
such
quantity
merit
between
them
just
enough
to
make
one
good
sort
man
late
has
been
shifting
about
pretty
much
for
my
part
inclined
to
believe
darcy
s
but
you
shall
do
as
you
choose
was
some
time
however
before
smile
could
be
extorted
from
jane
do
not
know
when
been
more
shocked
said
she
wickham
so
very
bad
almost
past
belief
poor
mr
darcy
dear
lizzy
only
consider
what
he
must
suffered
such
disappointment
with
knowledge
your
ill
opinion
too
having
to
relate
such
thing
his
sister
really
too
distressing
sure
you
must
feel
so
oh
no
my
regret
compassion
done
away
by
seeing
you
so
full
both
know
you
will
do
him
such
ample
justice
that
growing
every
moment
more
unconcerned
indifferent
your
profusion
makes
me
saving
if
you
lament
over
him
much
longer
my
heart
will
be
as
light
as
feather
poor
wickham
there
such
an
expression
goodness
in
his
countenance
such
an
openness
gentleness
in
his
manner
there
certainly
was
some
great
mismanagement
in
education
those
two
young
men
one
has
got
goodness
other
appearance
never
thought
mr
darcy
so
deficient
in
appearance
as
you
used
to
do
yet
meant
to
be
uncommonly
clever
in
taking
so
decided
dislike
to
him
without
any
reason
such
spur
to
one
s
genius
such
an
opening
for
wit
to
dislike
that
kind
one
may
be
continually
abusive
without
saying
anything
just
but
one
cannot
always
be
laughing
at
man
without
now
then
stumbling
on
something
witty
lizzy
when
you
first
read
that
letter
sure
you
could
not
treat
matter
as
you
do
now
indeed
could
not
was
uncomfortable
enough
may
say
unhappy
with
no
one
to
speak
to
about
what
felt
no
jane
to
comfort
me
say
that
had
not
been
so
very
weak
vain
nonsensical
as
knew
had
oh
how
wanted
you
how
unfortunate
that
you
used
such
very
strong
expressions
in
speaking
wickham
to
mr
darcy
for
now
they
do
appear
wholly
undeserved
certainly
but
misfortune
speaking
with
bitterness
most
natural
consequence
prejudices
had
been
encouraging
there
one
point
on
which
want
your
advice
want
to
be
told
whether
ought
or
ought
not
to
make
our
acquaintances
in
general
understand
wickham
s
character
miss
bennet
paused
little
then
replied
surely
there
can
be
no
occasion
for
exposing
him
so
dreadfully
what
your
opinion
that
ought
not
to
be
attempted
mr
darcy
has
not
authorised
me
to
make
his
communication
public
on
contrary
every
particular
relative
to
his
sister
was
meant
to
be
kept
as
much
as
possible
to
myself
if
endeavour
to
undeceive
people
as
to
rest
his
conduct
who
will
believe
me
general
prejudice
against
mr
darcy
so
violent
that
would
be
death
half
good
people
in
meryton
to
attempt
to
place
him
in
an
amiable
light
not
equal
to
wickham
will
soon
be
gone
therefore
will
not
signify
to
anyone
here
what
he
really
some
time
hence
will
be
found
out
then
we
may
laugh
at
their
stupidity
in
not
knowing
before
at
present
will
say
nothing
about
you
quite
right
to
his
errors
made
public
might
ruin
him
for
ever
he
now
perhaps
sorry
for
what
he
has
done
anxious
to
re
establish
character
we
must
not
make
him
desperate
tumult
elizabeth
s
mind
was
allayed
by
conversation
she
had
got
rid
two
secrets
which
had
weighed
on
her
for
fortnight
was
certain
willing
listener
in
jane
whenever
she
might
wish
to
talk
again
either
but
there
was
still
something
lurking
behind
which
prudence
forbade
disclosure
she
dared
not
relate
other
half
mr
darcy
s
letter
nor
explain
to
her
sister
how
sincerely
she
had
been
valued
by
her
friend
here
was
knowledge
in
which
no
one
could
partake
she
was
sensible
that
nothing
less
than
perfect
understanding
between
parties
could
justify
her
in
throwing
off
last
encumbrance
mystery
then
said
she
if
that
very
improbable
event
ever
take
place
shall
merely
be
able
to
tell
what
bingley
may
tell
in
much
more
agreeable
manner
himself
liberty
communication
cannot
be
mine
till
has
lost
its
value
she
was
now
on
being
settled
at
home
at
leisure
to
observe
real
state
her
sister
s
spirits
jane
was
not
happy
she
still
cherished
very
tender
affection
for
bingley
having
never
even
fancied
herself
in
love
before
her
regard
had
warmth
first
attachment
from
her
age
disposition
greater
steadiness
than
most
first
attachments
often
boast
so
fervently
did
she
value
his
remembrance
prefer
him
to
every
other
man
that
her
good
sense
her
attention
to
feelings
her
friends
were
requisite
to
check
indulgence
those
regrets
which
must
been
injurious
to
her
own
health
their
tranquillity
well
lizzy
said
mrs
bennet
one
day
what
your
opinion
now
sad
business
jane
s
for
my
part
determined
never
to
speak
again
to
anybody
told
my
sister
phillips
so
other
day
but
cannot
find
out
that
jane
saw
anything
him
in
london
well
he
very
undeserving
young
man
do
not
suppose
there
s
least
chance
in
world
her
ever
getting
him
now
there
no
talk
his
coming
to
netherfield
again
in
summer
inquired
everybody
too
who
likely
to
know
do
not
believe
he
will
ever
live
at
netherfield
any
more
oh
well
just
as
he
chooses
nobody
wants
him
to
come
though
shall
always
say
he
used
my
daughter
extremely
ill
if
was
her
would
not
put
up
with
well
my
comfort
sure
jane
will
die
broken
heart
then
he
will
be
sorry
for
what
he
has
done
but
as
elizabeth
could
not
receive
comfort
from
any
such
expectation
she
made
no
answer
well
lizzy
continued
her
mother
soon
afterwards
so
collinses
live
very
comfortable
do
they
well
well
only
hope
will
last
what
sort
table
do
they
keep
charlotte
an
excellent
manager
dare
say
if
she
half
as
sharp
as
her
mother
she
saving
enough
there
nothing
extravagant
in
their

dare
say
no
nothing
at

deal
good
management
depend
upon
yes
yes
they
will
take
care
not
to
outrun
their
income
they
will
never
be
distressed
for
money
well
much
good
may
do
them
so
suppose
they
often
talk
having
longbourn
when
your
father
dead
they
look
upon
as
quite
their
own
dare
say
whenever
that
happens
was
subject
which
they
could
not
mention
before
me
no
would
been
strange
if
they
had
but
make
no
doubt
they
often
talk
between
themselves
well
if
they
can
be
easy
with
an
estate
that
not
lawfully
their
own
so
much
better
be
ashamed
having
one
that
was
only
entailed
on
me
chapter
first
week
their
return
was
soon
gone
began
was
last
regiment
s
stay
in
meryton
young
ladies
in
neighbourhood
were
drooping
apace
dejection
was
almost
universal
elder
miss
bennets
alone
were
still
able
to
eat
drink
sleep
pursue
usual
course
their
employments
very
frequently
were
they
reproached
for
insensibility
by
kitty
lydia
whose
own
misery
was
extreme
who
could
not
comprehend
such
hard
heartedness
in
any
family
good
heaven
what
to
become
us
what
we
to
do
would
they
often
exclaim
in
bitterness
woe
how
can
you
be
smiling
so
lizzy
their
affectionate
mother
shared
their
grief
she
remembered
what
she
had
herself
endured
on
similar
occasion
five
twenty
years
ago
sure
said
she
cried
for
two
days
together
when
colonel
miller
s
regiment
went
away
thought
broken
my
heart
sure
shall
break
mine
said
lydia
if
one
could
but
go
to
brighton
observed
mrs
bennet
oh
yes
if
one
could
but
go
to
brighton
but
papa
so
disagreeable
little
sea
bathing
would
set
me
up
forever
my
aunt
phillips
sure
would
do
me
great
deal
good
added
kitty
such
were
kind
lamentations
resounding
perpetually
through
longbourn
house
elizabeth
tried
to
be
diverted
by
them
but
sense
pleasure
was
lost
in
shame
she
felt
anew
justice
mr
darcy
s
objections
never
had
she
been
so
much
disposed
to
pardon
his
interference
in
views
his
friend
but
gloom
lydia
s
prospect
was
shortly
cleared
away
for
she
received
an
invitation
from
mrs
forster
wife
colonel
regiment
to
accompany
her
to
brighton
invaluable
friend
was
very
young
woman
very
lately
married
resemblance
in
good
humour
good
spirits
had
recommended
her
lydia
to
each
other
out
their
months
acquaintance
they
had
been
intimate
two
rapture
lydia
on
occasion
her
adoration
mrs
forster
delight
mrs
bennet
mortification
kitty
scarcely
to
be
described
wholly
inattentive
to
her
sister
s
feelings
lydia
flew
about
house
in
restless
ecstasy
calling
for
everyone
s
congratulations
laughing
talking
with
more
violence
than
ever
whilst
luckless
kitty
continued
in
parlour
repined
at
her
fate
in
terms
as
unreasonable
as
her
accent
was
peevish
cannot
see
why
mrs
forster
not
ask
me
as
well
as
lydia
said
she
though
not
her
particular
friend
just
as
much
right
to
be
asked
as
she
has
more
too
for
two
years
older
in
vain
did
elizabeth
attempt
to
make
her
reasonable
jane
to
make
her
resigned
as
for
elizabeth
herself
invitation
was
so
far
from
exciting
in
her
same
feelings
as
in
her
mother
lydia
that
she
considered
as
death
warrant
possibility
common
sense
for
latter
detestable
as
such
step
must
make
her
were
known
she
could
not
help
secretly
advising
her
father
not
to
let
her
go
she
represented
to
him
improprieties
lydia
s
general
behaviour
little
advantage
she
could
derive
from
friendship
such
woman
as
mrs
forster
probability
her
being
yet
more
imprudent
with
such
companion
at
brighton
where
temptations
must
be
greater
than
at
home
he
heard
her
attentively
then
said
lydia
will
never
be
easy
until
she
has
exposed
herself
in
some
public
place
or
other
we
can
never
expect
her
to
do
with
so
little
expense
or
inconvenience
to
her
family
as
under
present
circumstances
if
you
were
aware
said
elizabeth
very
great
disadvantage
to
us
which
must
arise
from
public
notice
lydia
s
unguarded
imprudent
manner
nay
which
has
already
arisen
from
sure
you
would
judge
differently
in
affair
already
arisen
repeated
mr
bennet
what
has
she
frightened
away
some
your
lovers
poor
little
lizzy
but
do
not
be
cast
down
such
squeamish
youths
as
cannot
bear
to
be
connected
with
little
absurdity
not
worth
regret
come
let
me
see
list
pitiful
fellows
who
been
kept
aloof
by
lydia
s
folly
indeed
you
mistaken
no
such
injuries
to
resent
not
particular
but
general
evils
which
now
complaining
our
importance
our
respectability
in
world
must
be
affected
by
wild
volatility
assurance
disdain
restraint
which
mark
lydia
s
character
excuse
me
for
must
speak
plainly
if
you
my
dear
father
will
not
take
trouble
checking
her
exuberant
spirits
teaching
her
that
her
present
pursuits
not
to
be
business
her
life
she
will
soon
be
beyond
reach
amendment
her
character
will
be
fixed
she
will
at
sixteen
be
most
determined
flirt
that
ever
made
herself
or
her
family
ridiculous
flirt
too
in
worst
meanest
degree
flirtation
without
any
attraction
beyond
youth
tolerable
person
from
ignorance
emptiness
her
mind
wholly
unable
to
ward
off
any
portion
that
universal
contempt
which
her
rage
for
admiration
will
excite
in
danger
kitty
also
comprehended
she
will
follow
wherever
lydia
leads
vain
ignorant
idle
absolutely
uncontrolled
oh
my
dear
father
can
you
suppose
possible
that
they
will
not
be
censured
despised
wherever
they
known
that
their
sisters
will
not
be
often
involved
in
disgrace
mr
bennet
saw
that
her
whole
heart
was
in
subject
affectionately
taking
her
hand
said
in
reply
do
not
make
yourself
uneasy
my
love
wherever
you
jane
known
you
must
be
respected
valued
you
will
not
appear
to
less
advantage
for
having
couple
or
may
say
very
silly
sisters
we
shall
no
peace
at
longbourn
if
lydia
does
not
go
to
brighton
let
her
go
then
colonel
forster
sensible
man
will
keep
her
out
any
real
mischief
she
luckily
too
poor
to
be
an
object
prey
to
anybody
at
brighton
she
will
be
less
importance
even
as
common
flirt
than
she
has
been
here
officers
will
find
women
better
worth
their
notice
let
us
hope
therefore
that
her
being
there
may
teach
her
her
own
insignificance
at
any
rate
she
cannot
grow
many
degrees
worse
without
authorising
us
to
lock
her
up
for
rest
her
life
with
answer
elizabeth
was
forced
to
be
content
but
her
own
opinion
continued
same
she
left
him
disappointed
sorry
was
not
in
her
nature
however
to
increase
her
vexations
by
dwelling
on
them
she
was
confident
having
performed
her
duty
to
fret
over
unavoidable
evils
or
augment
them
by
anxiety
was
no
part
her
disposition
had
lydia
her
mother
known
substance
her
conference
with
her
father
their
indignation
would
hardly
found
expression
in
their
united
volubility
in
lydia
s
imagination
visit
to
brighton
comprised
every
possibility
earthly
happiness
she
saw
with
creative
eye
fancy
streets
that
gay
bathing
place
covered
with
officers
she
saw
herself
object
attention
to
tens
to
scores
them
at
present
unknown
she
saw
glories
camp
its
tents
stretched
forth
in
beauteous
uniformity
lines
crowded
with
young
gay
dazzling
with
scarlet
to
complete
view
she
saw
herself
seated
beneath
tent
tenderly
flirting
with
at
least
six
officers
at
once
had
she
known
her
sister
sought
to
tear
her
from
such
prospects
such
realities
as
these
what
would
been
her
sensations
they
could
been
understood
only
by
her
mother
who
might
felt
nearly
same
lydia
s
going
to
brighton
was
that
consoled
her
for
her
melancholy
conviction
her
husband
s
never
intending
to
go
there
himself
but
they
were
entirely
ignorant
what
had
passed
their
raptures
continued
with
little
intermission
to
very
day
lydia
s
leaving
home
elizabeth
was
now
to
see
mr
wickham
for
last
time
having
been
frequently
in
company
with
him
since
her
return
agitation
was
pretty
well
over
agitations
formal
partiality
entirely
so
she
had
even
learnt
to
detect
in
very
gentleness
which
had
first
delighted
her
an
affectation
sameness
to
disgust
weary
in
his
present
behaviour
to
herself
moreover
she
had
fresh
source
displeasure
for
inclination
he
soon
testified
renewing
those
intentions
which
had
marked
early
part
their
acquaintance
could
only
serve
after
what
had
since
passed
to
provoke
her
she
lost
concern
for
him
in
finding
herself
thus
selected
as
object
such
idle
frivolous
gallantry
while
she
steadily
repressed
could
not
but
feel
reproof
contained
in
his
believing
that
however
long
for
whatever
cause
his
attentions
had
been
withdrawn
her
vanity
would
be
gratified
her
preference
secured
at
any
time
by
their
renewal
on
very
last
day
regiment
s
remaining
at
meryton
he
dined
with
other
officers
at
longbourn
so
little
was
elizabeth
disposed
to
part
from
him
in
good
humour
that
on
his
making
some
inquiry
as
to
manner
in
which
her
time
had
passed
at
hunsford
she
mentioned
colonel
fitzwilliam
s
mr
darcy
s
having
both
spent
weeks
at
rosings
asked
him
if
he
was
acquainted
with
former
he
looked
surprised
displeased
alarmed
but
with
moment
s
recollection
returning
smile
replied
that
he
had
formerly
seen
him
often
after
observing
that
he
was
very
gentlemanlike
man
asked
her
how
she
had
liked
him
her
answer
was
warmly
in
his
favour
with
an
air
indifference
he
soon
afterwards
added
how
long
did
you
say
he
was
at
rosings
nearly
weeks
you
saw
him
frequently
yes
almost
every
day
his
manners
very
different
from
his
cousin
s
yes
very
different
but
think
mr
darcy
improves
upon
acquaintance
indeed
cried
mr
wickham
with
look
which
did
not
escape
her
pray
may
ask
but
checking
himself
he
added
in
gayer
tone
in
address
that
he
improves
has
he
deigned
to
add
aught
civility
to
his
ordinary
style
for
dare
not
hope
he
continued
in
lower
more
serious
tone
that
he
improved
in
essentials
oh
no
said
elizabeth
in
essentials
believe
he
very
much
what
he
ever
was
while
she
spoke
wickham
looked
as
if
scarcely
knowing
whether
to
rejoice
over
her
words
or
to
distrust
their
meaning
there
was
something
in
her
countenance
which
made
him
listen
with
an
apprehensive
anxious
attention
while
she
added
when
said
that
he
improved
on
acquaintance
did
not
mean
that
his
mind
or
his
manners
were
in
state
improvement
but
that
from
knowing
him
better
his
disposition
was
better
understood
wickham
s
alarm
now
appeared
in
heightened
complexion
agitated
look
for
few
minutes
he
was
silent
till
shaking
off
his
embarrassment
he
turned
to
her
again
said
in
gentlest
accents
you
who
so
well
know
my
feeling
towards
mr
darcy
will
readily
comprehend
how
sincerely
must
rejoice
that
he
wise
enough
to
assume
even
appearance
what
right
his
pride
in
that
direction
may
be
service
if
not
to
himself
to
many
others
for
must
only
deter
him
from
such
foul
misconduct
as
suffered
by
only
fear
that
sort
cautiousness
to
which
you
imagine
been
alluding
merely
adopted
on
his
visits
to
his
aunt
whose
good
opinion
judgement
he
stands
much
in
awe
his
fear
her
has
always
operated
know
when
they
were
together
good
deal
to
be
imputed
to
his
wish
forwarding
match
with
miss
de
bourgh
which
certain
he
has
very
much
at
heart
elizabeth
could
not
repress
smile
at
but
she
answered
only
by
slight
inclination
head
she
saw
that
he
wanted
to
engage
her
on
old
subject
his
grievances
she
was
in
no
humour
to
indulge
him
rest
evening
passed
with
appearance
on
his
side
usual
cheerfulness
but
with
no
further
attempt
to
distinguish
elizabeth
they
parted
at
last
with
mutual
civility
possibly
mutual
desire
never
meeting
again
when
party
broke
up
lydia
returned
with
mrs
forster
to
meryton
from
whence
they
were
to
set
out
early
next
morning
separation
between
her
her
family
was
rather
noisy
than
pathetic
kitty
was
only
one
who
shed
tears
but
she
did
weep
from
vexation
envy
mrs
bennet
was
diffuse
in
her
good
wishes
for
felicity
her
daughter
impressive
in
her
injunctions
that
she
not
miss
opportunity
enjoying
herself
as
much
as
possible
advice
which
there
was
every
reason
to
believe
would
be
well
attended
to
in
clamorous
happiness
lydia
herself
in
bidding
farewell
more
gentle
adieus
her
sisters
were
uttered
without
being
heard
chapter
had
elizabeth
s
opinion
been
drawn
from
her
own
family
she
could
not
formed
very
pleasing
opinion
conjugal
felicity
or
domestic
comfort
her
father
captivated
by
youth
beauty
that
appearance
good
humour
which
youth
beauty
generally
give
had
married
woman
whose
weak
understanding
illiberal
mind
had
very
early
in
their
marriage
put
an
end
to
real
affection
for
her
respect
esteem
confidence
had
vanished
for
ever
his
views
domestic
happiness
were
overthrown
but
mr
bennet
was
not
disposition
to
seek
comfort
for
disappointment
which
his
own
imprudence
had
brought
on
in
any
those
pleasures
which
too
often
console
unfortunate
for
their
folly
or
their
vice
he
was
fond
country
books
from
these
tastes
had
arisen
his
principal
enjoyments
to
his
wife
he
was
very
little
otherwise
indebted
than
as
her
ignorance
folly
had
contributed
to
his
amusement
not
sort
happiness
which
man
would
in
general
wish
to
owe
to
his
wife
but
where
other
powers
entertainment
wanting
true
philosopher
will
derive
benefit
from
such
as
given
elizabeth
however
had
never
been
blind
to
impropriety
her
father
s
behaviour
as
husband
she
had
always
seen
with
pain
but
respecting
his
abilities
grateful
for
his
affectionate
treatment
herself
she
endeavoured
to
forget
what
she
could
not
overlook
to
banish
from
her
thoughts
that
continual
breach
conjugal
obligation
decorum
which
in
exposing
his
wife
to
contempt
her
own
children
was
so
highly
reprehensible
but
she
had
never
felt
so
strongly
as
now
disadvantages
which
must
attend
children
so
unsuitable
marriage
nor
ever
been
so
fully
aware
evils
arising
from
so
ill
judged
direction
talents
talents
which
rightly
used
might
at
least
preserved
respectability
his
daughters
even
if
incapable
enlarging
mind
his
wife
when
elizabeth
had
rejoiced
over
wickham
s
departure
she
found
little
other
cause
for
satisfaction
in
loss
regiment
their
parties
abroad
were
less
varied
than
before
at
home
she
had
mother
sister
whose
constant
repinings
at
dullness
everything
around
them
threw
real
gloom
over
their
domestic
circle
though
kitty
might
in
time
regain
her
natural
degree
sense
since
disturbers
her
brain
were
removed
her
other
sister
from
whose
disposition
greater
evil
might
be
apprehended
was
likely
to
be
hardened
in
her
folly
assurance
by
situation
such
double
danger
as
watering
place
camp
upon
whole
therefore
she
found
what
has
been
sometimes
found
before
that
an
event
to
which
she
had
been
looking
with
impatient
desire
did
not
in
taking
place
bring
satisfaction
she
had
promised
herself
was
consequently
necessary
to
name
some
other
period
for
commencement
actual
felicity
to
some
other
point
on
which
her
wishes
hopes
might
be
fixed
by
again
enjoying
pleasure
anticipation
console
herself
for
present
prepare
for
another
disappointment
her
tour
to
lakes
was
now
object
her
happiest
thoughts
was
her
best
consolation
for
uncomfortable
hours
which
discontentedness
her
mother
kitty
made
inevitable
could
she
included
jane
in
scheme
every
part
would
been
perfect
but
fortunate
thought
she
that
something
to
wish
for
were
whole
arrangement
complete
my
disappointment
would
be
certain
but
here
by
carrying
with
me
one
ceaseless
source
regret
in
my
sister
s
absence
may
reasonably
hope
to
my
expectations
pleasure
realised
scheme
which
every
part
promises
delight
can
never
be
successful
general
disappointment
only
warded
off
by
defence
some
little
peculiar
vexation
when
lydia
went
away
she
promised
to
write
very
often
very
minutely
to
her
mother
kitty
but
her
letters
were
always
long
expected
always
very
short
those
to
her
mother
contained
little
else
than
that
they
were
just
returned
from
library
where
such
such
officers
had
attended
them
where
she
had
seen
such
beautiful
ornaments
as
made
her
quite
wild
that
she
had
new
gown
or
new
parasol
which
she
would
described
more
fully
but
was
obliged
to
leave
off
in
violent
hurry
as
mrs
forster
called
her
they
were
going
off
to
camp
from
her
correspondence
with
her
sister
there
was
still
less
to
be
learnt
for
her
letters
to
kitty
though
rather
longer
were
much
too

scene
mrs

s
former
residence
where
she
had
lately
learned
some
acquaintance
still
remained
they
bent
their
steps
after
having
seen
principal
wonders
country
within
five
miles
lambton
elizabeth
found
from
her
aunt
that
pemberley
was
situated
was
not
in
their
direct
road
nor
more
than
mile
or
two
out
in
talking
over
their
route
evening
before
mrs
gardiner
expressed
an
inclination
to
see
place
again
mr
gardiner
declared
his
willingness
elizabeth
was
applied
to
for
her
approbation
my
love
not
you
like
to
see
place
which
you
heard
so
much
said
her
aunt
place
too
with
which
so
many
your
acquaintances
connected
wickham
passed
his
youth
there
you
know
elizabeth
was
distressed
she
felt
that
she
had
no
business
at
pemberley
was
obliged
to
assume
disinclination
for
seeing
she
must
own
that
she
was
tired
seeing
great
houses
after
going
over
so
many
she
really
had
no
pleasure
in
fine
carpets
or
satin
curtains
mrs
gardiner
abused
her
stupidity
if
were
merely
fine
house
richly
furnished
said
she
not
care
about
myself
but
grounds
delightful
they
some
finest
woods
in
country
elizabeth
said
no
more
but
her
mind
could
not
acquiesce
possibility
meeting
mr
darcy
while
viewing
place
instantly
occurred
would
be
dreadful
she
blushed
at
very
idea
thought
would
be
better
to
speak
openly
to
her
aunt
than
to
run
such
risk
but
against
there
were
objections
she
finally
resolved
that
could
be
last
resource
if
her
private
inquiries
to
absence
family
were
unfavourably
answered
accordingly
when
she
retired
at
night
she
asked
chambermaid
whether
pemberley
were
not
very
fine
place
what
was
name
its
proprietor
with
no
little
alarm
whether
family
were
down
for
summer
most
welcome
negative
followed
last
question
her
alarms
now
being
removed
she
was
at
leisure
to
feel
great
deal
curiosity
to
see
house
herself
when
subject
was
revived
next
morning
she
was
again
applied
to
could
readily
answer
with
proper
air
indifference
that
she
had
not
really
any
dislike
to
scheme
to
pemberley
therefore
they
were
to
go
chapter
elizabeth
as
they
drove
along
watched
for
first
appearance
pemberley
woods
with
some
perturbation
when
at
length
they
turned
in
at
lodge
her
spirits
were
in
high
flutter
park
was
very
large
contained
great
variety
ground
they
entered
in
one
its
lowest
points
drove
for
some
time
through
beautiful
wood
stretching
over
wide
extent
elizabeth
s
mind
was
too
full
for
conversation
but
she
saw
admired
every
remarkable
spot
point
view
they
gradually
ascended
for
half
mile
then
found
themselves
at
top
considerable
eminence
where
wood
ceased
eye
was
instantly
caught
by
pemberley
house
situated
on
opposite
side
valley
into
which
road
with
some
abruptness
wound
was
large
handsome
stone
building
standing
well
on
rising
ground
backed
by
ridge
high
woody
hills
in
front
stream
some
natural
importance
was
swelled
into
greater
but
without
any
artificial
appearance
its
banks
were
neither
formal
nor
falsely
adorned
elizabeth
was
delighted
she
had
never
seen
place
for
which
nature
had
done
more
or
where
natural
beauty
had
been
so
little
counteracted
by
an
awkward
taste
they
were
them
warm
in
their
admiration
at
that
moment
she
felt
that
to
be
mistress
pemberley
might
be
something
they
descended
hill
crossed
bridge
drove
to
door
while
examining
nearer
aspect
house
her
apprehension
meeting
its
owner
returned
she
dreaded
lest
chambermaid
had
been
mistaken
on
applying
to
see
place
they
were
admitted
into
hall
elizabeth
as
they
waited
for
housekeeper
had
leisure
to
wonder
at
her
being
where
she
was
housekeeper
came
respectable
looking
elderly
woman
much
less
fine
more
civil
than
she
had
any
notion
finding
her
they
followed
her
into
dining
parlour
was
large
well
proportioned
room
handsomely
fitted
up
elizabeth
after
slightly
surveying
went
to
window
to
enjoy
its
prospect
hill
crowned
with
wood
which
they
had
descended
receiving
increased
abruptness
from
distance
was
beautiful
object
every
disposition
ground
was
good
she
looked
on
whole
scene
river
trees
scattered
on
its
banks
winding
valley
as
far
as
she
could
trace
with
delight
as
they
passed
into
other
rooms
these
objects
were
taking
different
positions
but
from
every
window
there
were
beauties
to
be
seen
rooms
were
lofty
handsome
their
furniture
suitable
to
fortune
its
proprietor
but
elizabeth
saw
with
admiration
his
taste
that
was
neither
gaudy
nor
uselessly
fine
with
less
splendour
more
real
elegance
than
furniture
rosings
place
thought
she
might
been
mistress
with
these
rooms
might
now
been
familiarly
acquainted
instead
viewing
them
as
stranger
might
rejoiced
in
them
as
my
own
welcomed
to
them
as
visitors
my
uncle
aunt
but
no
recollecting
herself
that
could
never
be
my
uncle
aunt
would
been
lost
to
me
not
been
allowed
to
invite
them
was
lucky
recollection
saved
her
from
something
very
like
regret
she
longed
to
inquire
housekeeper
whether
her
master
was
really
absent
but
had
not
courage
for
at
length
however
question
was
asked
by
her
uncle
she
turned
away
with
alarm
while
mrs
reynolds
replied
that
he
was
adding
but
we
expect
him
to
morrow
with
large
party
friends
how
rejoiced
was
elizabeth
that
their
own
journey
had
not
by
any
circumstance
been
delayed
day
her
aunt
now
called
her
to
look
at
picture
she
approached
saw
likeness
mr
wickham
suspended
amongst
several
other
miniatures
over
mantelpiece
her
aunt
asked
her
smilingly
how
she
liked
housekeeper
came
forward
told
them
was
picture
young
gentleman
son
her
late
master
s
steward
who
had
been
brought
up
by
him
at
his
own
expense
he
now
gone
into
army
she
added
but
afraid
he
has
turned
out
very
wild
mrs
gardiner
looked
at
her
niece
with
smile
but
elizabeth
could
not
return
that
said
mrs
reynolds
pointing
to
another
miniatures
my
master
very
like
him
was
drawn
at
same
time
as
other
about
eight
years
ago
heard
much
your
master
s
fine
person
said
mrs
gardiner
looking
at
picture
handsome
face
but
lizzy
you
can
tell
us
whether
like
or
not
mrs
reynolds
respect
for
elizabeth
seemed
to
increase
on
intimation
her
knowing
her
master
does
that
young
lady
know
mr
darcy
elizabeth
coloured
said
little
do
not
you
think
him
very
handsome
gentleman
ma
yes
very
handsome
sure
know
none
so
handsome
but
in
gallery
upstairs
you
will
see
finer
larger
picture
him
than
room
was
my
late
master
s
favourite
room
these
miniatures
just
as
they
used
to
be
then
he
was
very
fond
them
accounted
to
elizabeth
for
mr
wickham
s
being
among
them
mrs
reynolds
then
directed
their
attention
to
one
miss
darcy
drawn
when
she
was
only
eight
years
old
miss
darcy
as
handsome
as
her
brother
said
mrs
gardiner
oh
yes
handsomest
young
lady
that
ever
was
seen
so
accomplished
she
plays
sings
day
long
in
next
room
new
instrument
just
come
down
for
her
present
from
my
master
she
comes
here
to
morrow
with
him
mr
gardiner
whose
manners
were
very
easy
pleasant
encouraged
her
communicativeness
by
his
questions
remarks
mrs
reynolds
either
by
pride
or
attachment
had
evidently
great
pleasure
in
talking
her
master
his
sister
your
master
much
at
pemberley
in
course
year
not
so
much
as
could
wish
sir
but
dare
say
he
may
spend
half
his
time
here
miss
darcy
always
down
for
summer
months
except
thought
elizabeth
when
she
goes
to
ramsgate
if
your
master
would
marry
you
might
see
more
him
yes
sir
but
do
not
know
when
that
will
be
do
not
know
who
good
enough
for
him
mr
mrs
gardiner
smiled
elizabeth
could
not
help
saying
very
much
to
his
credit
sure
that
you
think
so
say
no
more
than
truth
everybody
will
say
that
knows
him
replied
other
elizabeth
thought
was
going
pretty
far
she
listened
with
increasing
astonishment
as
housekeeper
added
never
known
cross
word
from
him
in
my
life
known
him
ever
since
he
was
four
years
old
was
praise
others
most
extraordinary
most
opposite
to
her
ideas
that
he
was
not
good
tempered
man
had
been
her
firmest
opinion
her
keenest
attention
was
awakened
she
longed
to
hear
more
was
grateful
to
her
uncle
for
saying
there
very
few
people
whom
so
much
can
be
said
you
lucky
in
having
such
master
yes
sir
know
if
were
to
go
through
world
could
not
meet
with
better
but
always
observed
that
they
who
good
natured
when
children
good
natured
when
they
grow
up
he
was
always
sweetest
tempered
most
generous
hearted
boy
in
world
elizabeth
almost
stared
at
her
can
be
mr
darcy
thought
she
his
father
was
an
excellent
man
said
mrs
gardiner
yes
ma
that
he
was
indeed
his
son
will
be
just
like
him
just
as
affable
to
poor
elizabeth
listened
wondered
doubted
was
impatient
for
more
mrs
reynolds
could
interest
her
on
no
other
point
she
related
subjects
pictures
dimensions
rooms
price
furniture
in
vain
mr
gardiner
highly
amused
by
kind
family
prejudice
to
which
he
attributed
her
excessive
commendation
her
master
soon
led
again
to
subject
she
dwelt
with
energy
on
his
many
merits
as
they
proceeded
together
up
great
staircase
he
best
landlord
best
master
said
she
that
ever
lived
not
like
wild
young
men
nowadays
who
think
nothing
but
themselves
there
not
one
his
tenants
or
servants
but
will
give
him
good
name
some
people
call
him
proud
but
sure
never
saw
anything
to
my
fancy
only
because
he
does
not
rattle
away
like
other
young
men
in
what
an
amiable
light
does
place
him
thought
elizabeth
fine
account
him
whispered
her
aunt
as
they
walked
not
quite
consistent
with
his
behaviour
to
our
poor
friend
perhaps
we
might
be
deceived
that
not
very
likely
our
authority
was
too
good
on
reaching
spacious
lobby
above
they
were
shown
into
very
pretty
sitting
room
lately
fitted
up
with
greater
elegance
lightness
than
apartments
below
were
informed
that
was
but
just
done
to
give
pleasure
to
miss
darcy
who
had
taken
liking
to
room
when
last
at
pemberley
he
certainly
good
brother
said
elizabeth
as
she
walked
towards
one
windows
mrs
reynolds
anticipated
miss
darcy
s
delight
when
she
enter
room
always
way
with
him
she
added
whatever
can
give
his
sister
any
pleasure
sure
to
be
done
in
moment
there
nothing
he
would
not
do
for
her
picture
gallery
two
or
principal
bedrooms
were
that
remained
to
be
shown
in
former
were
many
good
paintings
but
elizabeth
knew
nothing
art
from
such
as
had
been
already
visible
below
she
had
willingly
turned
to
look
at
some
drawings
miss
darcy
s
in
crayons
whose
subjects
were
usually
more
interesting
also
more
intelligible
in
gallery
there
were
many
family
portraits
but
they
could
little
to
fix
attention
stranger
elizabeth
walked
in
quest
only
face
whose
features
would
be
known
to
her
at
last
arrested
her
she
beheld
striking
resemblance
to
mr
darcy
with
such
smile
over
face
as
she
remembered
to
sometimes
seen
when
he
looked
at
her
she
stood
several
minutes
before
picture
in
earnest
contemplation
returned
to
again
before
they
quitted
gallery
mrs
reynolds
informed
them
that
had
been
taken
in
his
father
s
lifetime
there
was
certainly
at
moment
in
elizabeth
s
mind
more
gentle
sensation
towards
original
than
she
had
ever
felt
at
height
their
acquaintance
commendation
bestowed
on
him
by
mrs
reynolds
was
no
trifling
nature
what
praise
more
valuable
than
praise
an
intelligent
servant
as
brother
landlord
master
she
considered
how
many
people
s
happiness
were
in
his
guardianship
how
much
pleasure
or
pain
was
in
his
power
to
bestow
how
much
good
or
evil
must
be
done
by
him
every
idea
that
had
been
brought
forward
by
housekeeper
was
favourable
to
his
character
as
she
stood
before
canvas
on
which
he
was
represented
fixed
his
eyes
upon
herself
she
thought
his
regard
with
deeper
sentiment
gratitude
than
had
ever
raised
before
she
remembered
its
warmth
softened
its
impropriety
expression
when
house
that
was
open
to
general
inspection
had
been
seen
they
returned
downstairs
taking
leave
housekeeper
were
consigned
over
to
gardener
who
met
them
at
hall
door
as
they
walked
across
hall
towards
river
elizabeth
turned
back
to
look
again
her
uncle
aunt
stopped
also
while
former
was
conjecturing
as
to
date
building
owner
himself
suddenly
came
forward
from
road
which
led
behind
to
stables
they
were
within
twenty
yards
each
other
so
abrupt
was
his
appearance
that
was
impossible
to
avoid
his
sight
their
eyes
instantly
met
cheeks
both
were
overspread
with
deepest
blush
he
absolutely
started
for
moment
seemed
immovable
from
surprise
but
shortly
recovering
himself
advanced
towards
party
spoke
to
elizabeth
if
not
in
terms
perfect
composure
at
least
perfect
civility
she
had
instinctively
turned
away
but
stopping
on
his
approach
received
his
compliments
with
an
embarrassment
impossible
to
be
overcome
had
his
first
appearance
or
his
resemblance
to
picture
they
had
just
been
examining
been
insufficient
to
assure
other
two
that
they
now
saw
mr
darcy
gardener
s
expression
surprise
on
beholding
his
master
must
immediately
told
they
stood
little
aloof
while
he
was
talking
to
their
niece
who
astonished
confused
scarcely
dared
lift
her
eyes
to
his
face
knew
not
what
answer
she
returned
to
his
civil
inquiries
after
her
family
amazed
at
alteration
his
manner
since
they
last
parted
every
sentence
that
he
uttered
was
increasing
her
embarrassment
every
idea
impropriety
her
being
found
there
recurring
to
her
mind
few
minutes
in
which
they
continued
were
some
most
uncomfortable
in
her
life
nor
did
he
seem
much
more
at
ease
when
he
spoke
his
accent
had
none
its
usual
sedateness
he
repeated
his
inquiries
as
to
time
her
having
left
longbourn
her
having
stayed
in
derbyshire
so
often
in
so
hurried
way
as
plainly
spoke
distraction
his
thoughts
at
length
every
idea
seemed
to
fail
him
after
standing
few
moments
without
saying
word
he
suddenly
recollected
himself
took
leave
others
then
joined
her
expressed
admiration
his
figure
but
elizabeth
heard
not
word
wholly
engrossed
by
her
own
feelings
followed
them
in
silence
she
was
overpowered
by
shame
vexation
her
coming
there
was
most
unfortunate
most
ill
judged
thing
in
world
how
strange
must
appear
to
him
in
what
disgraceful
light
might
not
strike
so
vain
man
might
seem
as
if
she
had
purposely
thrown
herself
in
his
way
again
oh
why
did
she
come
or
why
did
he
thus
come
day
before
he
was
expected
had
they
been
only
ten
minutes
sooner
they
been
beyond
reach
his
discrimination
for
was
plain
that
he
was
that
moment
arrived
that
moment
alighted
from
his
horse
or
his
carriage
she
blushed
again
again
over
perverseness
meeting
his
behaviour
so
strikingly
altered
what
could
mean
that
he
even
speak
to
her
was
amazing
but
to
speak
with
such
civility
to
inquire
after
her
family
never
in
her
life
had
she
seen
his
manners
so
little
dignified
never
had
he
spoken
with
such
gentleness
as
on
unexpected
meeting
what
contrast
did
offer
to
his
last
address
in
rosings
park
when
he
put
his
letter
into
her
hand
she
knew
not
what
to
think
or
how
to
account
for
they
had
now
entered
beautiful
walk
by
side
water
every
step
was
bringing
forward
nobler
fall
ground
or
finer
reach
woods
to
which
they
were
approaching
but
was
some
time
before
elizabeth
was
sensible
any
though
she
answered
mechanically
to
repeated
appeals
her
uncle
aunt
seemed
to
direct
her
eyes
to
such
objects
as
they
pointed
out
she
distinguished
no
part
scene
her
thoughts
were
fixed
on
that
one
spot
pemberley
house
whichever
might
be
where
mr
darcy
then
was
she
longed
to
know
what
at
moment
was
passing
in
his
mind
in
what
manner
he
thought
her
whether
in
defiance
everything
she
was
still
dear
to
him
perhaps
he
had
been
civil
only
because
he
felt
himself
at
ease
yet
there
had
been
that
in
his
voice
which
was
not
like
ease
whether
he
had
felt
more
pain
or
pleasure
in
seeing
her
she
could
not
tell
but
he
certainly
had
not
seen
her
with
composure
at
length
however
remarks
her
companions
on
her
absence
mind
aroused
her
she
felt
necessity
appearing
more
like
herself
they
entered
woods
bidding
adieu
to
river
for
while
ascended
some
higher
grounds
when
in
spots
where
opening
trees
gave
eye
power
to
wander
were
many
charming
views
valley
opposite
hills
with
long
range
woods
overspreading
many
occasionally
part
stream
mr
gardiner
expressed
wish
going
round
whole
park
but
feared
might
be
beyond
walk
with
triumphant
smile
they
were
told
that
was
ten
miles
round
settled
matter
they
pursued
accustomed
circuit
which
brought
them
again
after
some
time
in
descent
among
hanging
woods
to
edge
water
one
its
narrowest
parts
they
crossed
by
bridge
in
character
with
general
air
scene
was
spot
less
adorned
than
any
they
had
yet
visited
valley
here
contracted
into
glen
allowed
room
only
for
stream
narrow
walk
amidst
rough
coppice
wood
which
bordered
elizabeth
longed
to
explore
its
windings
but
when
they
had
crossed
bridge
perceived
their
distance
from
house
mrs
gardiner
who
was
not
great
walker
could
go
no
farther
thought
only
returning
to
carriage
as
quickly
as
possible
her
niece
was
therefore
obliged
to
submit
they
took
their
way
towards
house
on
opposite
side
river
in
nearest
direction
but
their
progress
was
slow
for
mr
gardiner
though
seldom
able
to
indulge
taste
was
very
fond
fishing
was
so
much
engaged
in
watching
occasional
appearance
some
trout
in
water
talking
to
man
about
them
that
he
advanced
but
little
whilst
wandering
on
in
slow
manner
they
were
again
surprised
elizabeth
s
astonishment
was
quite
equal
to
what
had
been
at
first
by
sight
mr
darcy
approaching
them
at
no
great
distance
walk
here
being
here
less
sheltered
than
on
other
side
allowed
them
to
see
him
before
they
met
elizabeth
however
astonished
was
at
least
more
prepared
for
an
interview
than
before
resolved
to
appear
to
speak
with
calmness
if
he
really
intended
to
meet
them
for
few
moments
indeed
she
felt
that
he
would
probably
strike
into
some
other
path
idea
lasted
while
turning
in
walk
concealed
him
from
their
view
turning
past
he
was
immediately
before
them
with
glance
she
saw
that
he
had
lost
none
his
recent
civility
to
imitate
his
politeness
she
began
as
they
met
to
admire
beauty
place
but
she
had
not
got
beyond
words
delightful
charming
when
some
unlucky
recollections
obtruded
she
fancied
that
praise
pemberley
from
her
might
be
mischievously
construed
her
colour
changed
she
said
no
more
mrs
gardiner
was
standing
little
behind
on
her
pausing
he
asked
her
if
she
would
do
him
honour
introducing
him
to
her
friends
was
stroke
civility
for
which
she
was
quite
unprepared
she
could
hardly
suppress
smile
at
his
being
now
seeking
acquaintance
some
those
very
people
against
whom
his
pride
had
revolted
in
his
offer
to
herself
what
will
be
his
surprise
thought
she
when
he
knows
who
they
he
takes
them
now
for
people
fashion
introduction
however
was
immediately
made
as
she
named
their
relationship
to
herself
she
stole
sly
look
at
him
to
see
how
he
bore
was
not
without
expectation
his
decamping
as
fast
as
he
could
from
such
disgraceful
companions
that
he
was
surprised
by
connection
was
evident
he
sustained
however
with
fortitude
so
far
from
going
away
turned
his
back
with
them
entered
into
conversation
with
mr
gardiner
elizabeth
could
not
but
be
pleased
could
not
but
triumph
was
consoling
that
he
know
she
had
some
relations
for
whom
there
was
no
need
to
blush
she
listened
most
attentively
to
that
passed
between
them
gloried
in
every
expression
every
sentence
her
uncle
which
marked
his
intelligence
his
taste
or
his
good
manners
conversation
soon
turned
upon
fishing
she
heard
mr
darcy
invite
him
with
greatest
civility
to
fish
there
as
often
as
he
chose
while
he
continued
in
neighbourhood
offering
at
same
time
to
supply
him
with
fishing
tackle
pointing
out
those
parts
stream
where
there
was
usually
most
sport
mrs
gardiner
who
was
walking
arm
in
arm
with
elizabeth
gave
her
look
expressive
wonder
elizabeth
said
nothing
but
gratified
her
exceedingly
compliment
must
be
for
herself
her
astonishment
however
was
extreme
continually
was
she
repeating
why
he
so
altered
from
what
can
proceed
cannot
be
for
me
cannot
be
for
my
sake
that
his
manners
thus
softened
my
reproofs
at
hunsford
could
not
work
such
change
as
impossible
that
he
still
love
me
after
walking
some
time
in
way
two
ladies
in
front
two
gentlemen
behind
on
resuming
their
places
after
descending
to
brink
river
for
better
inspection
some
curious
water
plant
there
chanced
to
be
little
alteration
originated
in
mrs
gardiner
who
fatigued
by
exercise
morning
found
elizabeth
s
arm
inadequate
to
her
support
consequently
preferred
her
husband
s
mr
darcy
took
her
place
by
her
niece
they
walked
on
together
after
short
silence
lady
first
spoke
she
wished
him
to
know
that
she
had
been
assured
his
absence
before
she
came
to
place
accordingly
began
by
observing
that
his
arrival
had
been
very
unexpected
for
your
housekeeper
she
added
informed
us
that
you
would
certainly
not
be
here
till
to
morrow
indeed
before
we
left
bakewell
we
understood
that
you
were
not
immediately
expected
in
country
he
acknowledged
truth
said
that
business
with
his
steward
had
occasioned
his
coming
forward
few
hours
before
rest
party
with
whom
he
had
been
travelling
they
will
join
me
early
to
morrow
he
continued
among
them
some
who
will
claim
an
acquaintance
with
you
mr
bingley
his
sisters
elizabeth
answered
only
by
slight
bow
her
thoughts
were
instantly
driven
back
to
time
when
mr
bingley
s
name
had
been
last
mentioned
between
them
if
she
might
judge
by
his
complexion
his
mind
was
not
very
differently
engaged
there
also
one
other
person
in
party
he
continued
after
pause
who
more
particularly
wishes
to
be
known
to
you
will
you
allow
me
or
do
ask
too
much
to
introduce
my
sister
to
your
acquaintance
during
your
stay
at
lambton
surprise
such
an
application
was
great
indeed
was
too
great
for
her
to
know
in
what
manner
she
acceded
to
she
immediately
felt
that
whatever
desire
miss
darcy
might
being
acquainted
with
her
must
be
work
her
brother
without
looking
farther
was
satisfactory
was
gratifying
to
know
that
his
resentment
had
not
made
him
think
really
ill
her
they
now
walked
on
in
silence
each
them
deep
in
thought
elizabeth
was
not
comfortable
that
was
impossible
but
she
was
flattered
pleased
his
wish
introducing
his
sister
to
her
was
compliment
highest
kind
they
soon
outstripped
others
when
they
had
reached
carriage
mr
mrs
gardiner
were
half
quarter
mile
behind
he
then
asked
her
to
walk
into
house
but
she
declared
herself
not
tired
they
stood
together
on
lawn
at
such
time
much
might
been
said
silence
was
very
awkward
she
wanted
to
talk
but
there
seemed
to
be
an
embargo
on
every
subject
at
last
she
recollected
that
she
had
been
travelling
they
talked
matlock
dove
dale
with
great
perseverance
yet
time
her
aunt
moved
slowly
her
patience
her
ideas
were
nearly
worn
our
before
tete
tete
was
over
on
mr
mrs
gardiner
s
coming
up
they
were
pressed
to
go
into
house
take
some
refreshment
but
was
declined
they
parted
on
each
side
with
utmost
politeness
mr
darcy
handed
ladies
into
carriage
when
drove
off
elizabeth
saw
him
walking
slowly
towards
house
observations
her
uncle
aunt
now
began
each
them
pronounced
him
to
be
infinitely
superior
to
anything
they
had
expected
he
perfectly
well
behaved
polite
unassuming
said
her
uncle
there
something
little
stately
in
him
to
be
sure
replied
her
aunt
but
confined
to
his
air
not
unbecoming
can
now
say
with
housekeeper
that
though
some
people
may
call
him
proud
seen
nothing
was
never
more
surprised
than
by
his
behaviour
to
us
was
more
than
civil
was
really
attentive
there
was
no
necessity
for
such
attention
his
acquaintance
with
elizabeth
was
very
trifling
to
be
sure
lizzy
said
her
aunt
he
not
so
handsome
as
wickham
or
rather
he
has
not
wickham
s
countenance
for
his
features
perfectly
good
but
how
came
you
to
tell
me
that
he
was
so
disagreeable
elizabeth
excused
herself
as
well
as
she
could
said
that
she
had
liked
him
better
when
they
had
met
in
kent
than
before
that
she
had
never
seen
him
so
pleasant
as
morning
but
perhaps
he
may
be
little
whimsical
in
his
civilities
replied
her
uncle
your
great
men
often
therefore
shall
not
take
him
at
his
word
as
he
might
change
his
mind
another
day
warn
me
off
his
grounds
elizabeth
felt
that
they
had
entirely
misunderstood
his
character
but
said
nothing
from
what
we
seen
him
continued
mrs
gardiner
really
not
thought
that
he
could
behaved
in
so
cruel
way
by
anybody
as
he
has
done
by
poor
wickham
he
has
not
an
ill
natured
look
on
contrary
there
something
pleasing
about
his
mouth
when
he
speaks
there
something
dignity
in
his
countenance
that
would
not
give
one
an
unfavourable
idea
his
heart
but
to
be
sure
good
lady
who
showed
us
his
house
did
give
him
most
flaming
character
could
hardly
help
laughing
aloud
sometimes
but
he
liberal
master
suppose
that
in
eye
servant
comprehends
every
virtue
elizabeth
here
felt
herself
called
on
to
say
something
in
vindication
his
behaviour
to
wickham
therefore
gave
them
to
understand
in
as
guarded
manner
as
she
could
that
by
what
she
had
heard
from
his
relations
in
kent
his
actions
were
capable
very
different
construction
that
his
character
was
by
no
means
so
faulty
nor
wickham
s
so
amiable
as
they
had
been
considered
in
hertfordshire
in
confirmation
she
related
particulars
pecuniary
transactions
in
which
they
had
been
connected
without
actually
naming
her
authority
but
stating
to
be
such
as
might
be
relied
on
mrs
gardiner
was
surprised
concerned
but
as
they
were
now
approaching
scene
her
former
pleasures
every
idea
gave
way
to
charm
recollection
she
was
too
much
engaged
in
pointing
out
to
her
husband
interesting
spots
in
its
environs
to
think
anything
else
fatigued
as
she
had
been
by
morning
s
walk
they
had
no
sooner
dined
than
she
set
off
again
in
quest
her
former
acquaintance
evening
was
spent
in
satisfactions
intercourse
renewed
after
many
years
discontinuance
occurrences
day
were
too
full
interest
to
leave
elizabeth
much
attention
for
any
these
new
friends
she
could
do
nothing
but
think
think
with
wonder
mr
darcy
s
civility
above
his
wishing
her
to
be
acquainted
with
his
sister
chapter
elizabeth
had
settled
that
mr
darcy
would
bring
his
sister
to
visit
her
very
day
after
her
reaching
pemberley
was
consequently
resolved
not
to
be
out
sight
inn
whole
that
morning
but
her
conclusion
was
false
for
on
very
morning
after
their
arrival
at
lambton
these
visitors
came
they
had
been
walking
about
place
with
some
their
new
friends
were
just
returning
to
inn
to
dress
themselves
for
dining
with
same
family
when
sound
carriage
drew
them
to
window
they
saw
gentleman
lady
in
curricle
driving
up
street
elizabeth
immediately
recognizing
livery
guessed
what
meant
imparted
no
small
degree
her
surprise
to
her
relations
by
acquainting
them
with
honour
which
she
expected
her
uncle
aunt
were
amazement
embarrassment
her
manner
as
she
spoke
joined
to
circumstance
itself
many
circumstances
preceding
day
opened
to
them
new
idea
on
business
nothing
had
ever
suggested
before
but
they
felt
that
there
was
no
other
way
accounting
for
such
attentions
from
such
quarter
than
by
supposing
partiality
for
their
niece
while
these
newly
born
notions
were
passing
in
their
heads
perturbation
elizabeth
s
feelings
was
at
every
moment
increasing
she
was
quite
amazed
at
her
own
discomposure
but
amongst
other
causes
disquiet
she
dreaded
lest
partiality
brother
said
too
much
in
her
favour
more
than
commonly
anxious
to
please
she
naturally
suspected
that
every
power
pleasing
would
fail
her
she
retreated
from
window
fearful
being
seen
as
she
walked
up
down
room
endeavouring
to
compose
herself
saw
such
looks
inquiring
surprise
in
her
uncle
aunt
as
made
everything
worse
miss
darcy
her
brother
appeared
formidable
introduction
took
place
with
astonishment
did
elizabeth
see
that
her
new
acquaintance
was
at
least
as
much
embarrassed
as
herself
since
her
being
at
lambton
she
had
heard
that
miss
darcy
was
exceedingly
proud
but
observation
very
few
minutes
convinced
her
that
she
was
only
exceedingly
shy
she
found
difficult
to
obtain
even
word
from
her
beyond
monosyllable
miss
darcy
was
tall
on
larger
scale
than
elizabeth
though
little
more
than
sixteen
her
figure
was
formed
her
appearance
womanly
graceful
she
was
less
handsome
than
her
brother
but
there
was
sense
good
humour
in
her
face
her
manners
were
perfectly
unassuming
gentle
elizabeth
who
had
expected
to
find
in
her
as
acute
unembarrassed
an
observer
as
ever
mr
darcy
had
been
was
much
relieved
by
discerning
such
different
feelings
they
had
not
long
been
together
before
mr
darcy
told
her
that
bingley
was
also
coming
to
wait
on
her
she
had
barely
time
to
express
her
satisfaction
prepare
for
such
visitor
when
bingley
s
quick
step
was
heard
on
stairs
in
moment
he
entered
room
elizabeth
s
anger
against
him
had
been
long
done
away
but
had
she
still
felt
any
could
hardly
stood
its
ground
against
unaffected
cordiality
with
which
he
expressed
himself
on
seeing
her
again
he
inquired
in
friendly
though
general
way
after
her
family
looked
spoke
with
same
good
humoured
ease
that
he
had
ever
done
to
mr
mrs
gardiner
he
was
scarcely
less
interesting
personage
than
to
herself
they
had
long
wished
to
see
him
whole
party
before
them
indeed
excited
lively
attention
suspicions
which
had
just
arisen
mr
darcy
their
niece
directed
their
observation
towards
each
with
an
earnest
though
guarded
inquiry
they
soon
drew
from
those
inquiries
full
conviction
that
one
them
at
least
knew
what
was
to
love
lady
s
sensations
they
remained
little
in
doubt
but
that
gentleman
was
overflowing
with
admiration
was
evident
enough
elizabeth
on
her
side
had
much
to
do
she
wanted
to
ascertain
feelings
each
her
visitors
she
wanted
to
compose
her
own
to
make
herself
agreeable
to
in
latter
object
where
she
feared
most
to
fail
she
was
most
sure
success
for
those
to
whom
she
endeavoured
to
give
pleasure
were
prepossessed
in
her
favour
bingley
was
ready
georgiana
was
eager
darcy
determined
to
be
pleased
in
seeing
bingley
her
thoughts
naturally
flew
to
her
sister
oh
how
ardently
did
she
long
to
know
whether
any
his
were
directed
in
like
manner
sometimes
she
could
fancy
that
he
talked
less
than
on
former
occasions
once
or
twice
pleased
herself
with
notion
that
as
he
looked
at
her
he
was
trying
to
trace
resemblance
but
though
might
be
imaginary
she
could
not
be
deceived
as
to
his
behaviour
to
miss
darcy
who
had
been
set
up
as
rival
to
jane
no
look
appeared
on
either
side
that
spoke
particular
regard
nothing
occurred
between
them
that
could
justify
hopes
his
sister
on
point
she
was
soon
satisfied
two
or
little
circumstances
occurred
ere
they
parted
which
in
her
anxious
interpretation
denoted
recollection
jane
not
untinctured
by
tenderness
wish
saying
more
that
might
lead
to
mention
her
had
he
dared
he
observed
to
her
at
moment
when
others
were
talking
together
in
tone
which
had
something
real
regret
that
was
very
long
time
since
he
had
had
pleasure
seeing
her
before
she
could
reply
he
added
above
eight
months
we
not
met
since
th
november
when
we
were
dancing
together
at
netherfield
elizabeth
was
pleased
to
find
his
memory
so
exact
he
afterwards
took
occasion
to
ask
her
when
unattended
to
by
any
rest
whether
her
sisters
were
at
longbourn
there
was
not
much
in
question
nor
in
preceding
remark
but
there
was
look
manner
which
gave
them
meaning
was
not
often
that
she
could
turn
her
eyes
on
mr
darcy
himself
but
whenever
she
did
catch
glimpse
she
saw
an
expression
general
complaisance
in
that
he
said
she
heard
an
accent
so
removed
from
hauteur
or
disdain
his
companions
as
convinced
her
that
improvement
manners
which
she
had
yesterday
witnessed
however
temporary
its
existence
might
prove
had
at
least
outlived
one
day
when
she
saw
him
thus
seeking
acquaintance
courting
good
opinion
people
with
whom
any
intercourse
few
months
ago
would
been
disgrace
when
she
saw
him
thus
civil
not
only
to
herself
but
to
very
relations
whom
he
had
openly
disdained
recollected
their
last
lively
scene
in
hunsford
parsonage
difference
change
was
so
great
struck
so
forcibly
on
her
mind
that
she
could
hardly
restrain
her
astonishment
from
being
visible
never
even
in
company
his
dear
friends
at
netherfield
or
his
dignified
relations
at
rosings
had
she
seen
him
so
desirous
to
please
so
from
self
consequence
or
unbending
reserve
as
now
when
no
importance
could
result
from
success
his
endeavours
when
even
acquaintance
those
to
whom
his
attentions
were
addressed
would
draw
down
ridicule
censure
ladies
both
netherfield
rosings
their
visitors
stayed
with
them
above
half
an
hour
when
they
arose
to
depart
mr
darcy
called
on
his
sister
to
join
him
in
expressing
their
wish
seeing
mr
mrs
gardiner
miss
bennet
to
dinner
at
pemberley
before
they
left
country
miss
darcy
though
with
diffidence
which
marked
her
little
in
habit
giving
invitations
readily
obeyed
mrs
gardiner
looked
at
her
niece
desirous
knowing
how
she
whom
invitation
most
concerned
felt
disposed
as
to
its
acceptance
but
elizabeth
had
turned
away
her
head
presuming
however
that
studied
avoidance
spoke
rather
momentary
embarrassment
than
any
dislike
proposal
seeing
in
her
husband
who
was
fond
society
perfect
willingness
to
accept
she
ventured
to
engage
for
her
attendance
day
after
next
was
fixed
on
bingley
expressed
great
pleasure
in
certainty
seeing
elizabeth
again
having
still
great
deal
to
say
to
her
many
inquiries
to
make
after
their
hertfordshire
friends
elizabeth
construing
into
wish
hearing
her
speak
her
sister
was
pleased
on
account
as
well
as
some
others
found
herself
when
their
visitors
left
them
capable
considering
last
half
hour
with
some
satisfaction
though
while
was
passing
enjoyment
had
been
little
eager
to
be
alone
fearful
inquiries
or
hints
from
her
uncle
aunt
she
stayed
with
them
only
long
enough
to
hear
their
favourable
opinion
bingley
then
hurried
away
to
dress
but
she
had
no
reason
to
fear
mr
mrs
gardiner
s
curiosity
was
not
their
wish
to
force
her
communication
was
evident
that
she
was
much
better
acquainted
with
mr
darcy
than
they
had
before
any
idea
was
evident
that
he
was
very
much
in
love
with
her
they
saw
much
to
interest
but
nothing
to
justify
inquiry
mr
darcy
was
now
matter
anxiety
to
think
well
as
far
as
their
acquaintance
reached
there
was
no
fault
to
find
they
could
not
be
untouched
by
his
politeness
had
they
drawn
his
character
from
their
own
feelings
his
servant
s
report
without
any
reference
to
any
other
account
circle
in
hertfordshire
to
which
he
was
known
would
not
recognized
for
mr
darcy
there
was
now
an
interest
however
in
believing
housekeeper
they
soon
became
sensible
that
authority
servant
who
had
known
him
since
he
was
four
years
old
whose
own
manners
indicated
respectability
was
not
to
be
hastily
rejected
neither
had
anything
occurred
in
intelligence
their
lambton
friends
that
could
materially
lessen
its
weight
they
had
nothing
to
accuse
him
but
pride
pride
he
probably
had
if
not
would
certainly
be
imputed
by
inhabitants
small
market
town
where
family
did
not
visit
was
acknowledged
however
that
he
was
liberal
man
did
much
good
among
poor
with
respect
to
wickham
travellers
soon
found
that
he
was
not
held
there
in
much
estimation
for
though
chief
his
concerns
with
son
his
patron
were
imperfectly
understood
was
yet
well
known
fact
that
on
his
quitting
derbyshire
he
had
left
many
debts
behind
him
which
mr
darcy
afterwards
discharged
as
for
elizabeth
her
thoughts
were
at
pemberley
evening
more
than
last
evening
though
as
passed
seemed
long
was
not
long
enough
to
determine
her
feelings
towards
one
in
that
mansion
she
lay
awake
two
whole
hours
endeavouring
to
make
them
out
she
certainly
did
not
hate
him
no
hatred
had
vanished
long
ago
she
had
almost
as
long
been
ashamed
ever
feeling
dislike
against
him
that
could
be
so
called
respect
created
by
conviction
his
valuable
qualities
though
at
first
unwillingly
admitted
had
for
some
time
ceased
to
be
repugnant
to
her
feeling
was
now
heightened
into
somewhat
friendlier
nature
by
testimony
so
highly
in
his
favour
bringing
forward
his
disposition
in
so
amiable
light
which
yesterday
had
produced
but
above
above
respect
esteem
there
was
motive
within
her
goodwill
which
could
not
be
overlooked
was
gratitude
gratitude
not
merely
for
having
once
loved
her
but
for
loving
her
still
well
enough
to
forgive
petulance
acrimony
her
manner
in
rejecting
him
unjust
accusations
accompanying
her
rejection
he
who
she
had
been
persuaded
would
avoid
her
as
his
greatest
enemy
seemed
on
accidental
meeting
most
eager
to
preserve
acquaintance
without
any
indelicate
display
regard
or
any
peculiarity
manner
where
their
two
selves
only
were
concerned
was
soliciting
good
opinion
her
friends
bent
on
making
her
known
to
his
sister
such
change
in
man
so
much
pride
exciting
not
only
astonishment
but
gratitude
for
to
love
ardent
love
must
be
attributed
as
such
its
impression
on
her
was
sort
to
be
encouraged
as
by
no
means
unpleasing
though
could
not
be
exactly
defined
she
respected
she
esteemed
she
was
grateful
to
him
she
felt
real
interest
in
his
welfare
she
only
wanted
to
know
how
far
she
wished
that
welfare
to
depend
upon
herself
how
far
would
be
for
happiness
both
that
she
employ
power
which
her
fancy
told
her
she
still
possessed
bringing
on
her
renewal
his
addresses
had
been
settled
in
evening
between
aunt
niece
that
such
striking
civility
as
miss
darcy
s
in
coming
to
see
them
on
very
day
her
arrival
at
pemberley
for
she
had
reached
only
to
late
breakfast
ought
to
be
imitated
though
could
not
be
equalled
by
some
exertion
politeness
on
their
side
consequently
that
would
be
highly
expedient
to
wait
on
her
at
pemberley
following
morning
they
were
therefore
to
go
elizabeth
was
pleased
though
when
she
asked
herself
reason
she
had
very
little
to
say
in
reply
mr
gardiner
left
them
soon
after
breakfast
fishing
scheme
had
been
renewed
day
before
positive
engagement
made
his
meeting
some
gentlemen
at
pemberley
before
noon
chapter
convinced
as
elizabeth
now
was
that
miss
bingley
s
dislike
her
had
originated
in
jealousy
she
could
not
help
feeling
how
unwelcome
her
appearance
at
pemberley
must
be
to
her
was
curious
to
know
with
how
much
civility
on
that
lady
s
side
acquaintance
would
now
be
renewed
on
reaching
house
they
were
shown
through
hall
into
saloon
whose
northern
aspect
rendered
delightful
for
summer
its
windows
opening
to
ground
admitted
most
refreshing
view
high
woody
hills
behind
house
beautiful
oaks
spanish
chestnuts
which
were
scattered
over
intermediate
lawn
in
house
they
were
received
by
miss
darcy
who
was
sitting
there
with
mrs
hurst
miss
bingley
lady
with
whom
she
lived
in
london
georgiana
s
reception
them
was
very
civil
but
attended
with
embarrassment
which
though
proceeding
from
shyness
fear
doing
wrong
would
easily
give
to
those
who
felt
themselves
inferior
belief
her
being
proud
reserved
mrs
gardiner
her
niece
however
did
her
justice
pitied
her
by
mrs
hurst
miss
bingley
they
were
noticed
only
by
curtsey
on
their
being
seated
pause
awkward
as
such
pauses
must
always
be
succeeded
for
few
moments
was
first
broken
by
mrs
annesley
genteel
agreeable
looking
woman
whose
endeavour
to
introduce
some
kind
discourse
proved
her
to
be
more
truly
well
bred
than
either
others
between
her
mrs
gardiner
with
occasional
help
from
elizabeth
conversation
was
carried
on
miss
darcy
looked
as
if
she
wished
for
courage
enough
to
join
in
sometimes
did
venture
short
sentence
when
there
was
least
danger
its
being
heard
elizabeth
soon
saw
that
she
was
herself
closely
watched
by
miss
bingley
that
she
could
not
speak
word
especially
to
miss
darcy
without
calling
her
attention
observation
would
not
prevented
her
from
trying
to
talk
to
latter
had
they
not
been
seated
at
an
inconvenient
distance
but
she
was
not
sorry
to
be
spared
necessity
saying
much
her
own
thoughts
were
employing
her
she
expected
every
moment
that
some
gentlemen
would
enter
room
she
wished
she
feared
that
master
house
might
be
amongst
them
whether
she
wished
or
feared
most
she
could
scarcely
determine
after
sitting
in
manner
quarter
an
hour
without
hearing
miss
bingley
s
voice
elizabeth
was
roused
by
receiving
from
her
cold
inquiry
after
health
her
family
she
answered
with
equal
indifference
brevity
others
said
no
more
next
variation
which
their
visit
afforded
was
produced
by
entrance
servants
with
cold
meat
cake
variety
finest
fruits
in
season
but
did
not
take
place
till
after
many
significant
look
smile
from
mrs
annesley
to
miss
darcy
had
been
given
to
remind
her
her
post
there
was
now
employment
for
whole
party
for
though
they
could
not
talk
they
could
eat
beautiful
pyramids
grapes
nectarines
peaches
soon
collected
them
round
table
while
thus
engaged
elizabeth
had
fair
opportunity
deciding
whether
she
most
feared
or
wished
for
appearance
mr
darcy
by
feelings
which
prevailed
on
his
entering
room
then
though
but
moment
before
she
had
believed
her
wishes
to
predominate
she
began
to
regret
that
he
came
he
had
been
some
time
with
mr
gardiner
who
with
two
or
other
gentlemen
from
house
was
engaged
by
river
had
left
him
only
on
learning
that
ladies
family
intended
visit
to
georgiana
that
morning
no
sooner
did
he
appear
than
elizabeth
wisely
resolved
to
be
perfectly
easy
unembarrassed
resolution
more
necessary
to
be
made
but
perhaps
not
more
easily
kept
because
she
saw
that
suspicions
whole
party
were
awakened
against
them
that
there
was
scarcely
an
eye
which
did
not
watch
his
behaviour
when
he
first
came
into
room
in
no
countenance
was
attentive
curiosity
so
strongly
marked
as
in
miss
bingley
s
in
spite
smiles
which
overspread
her
face
whenever
she
spoke
to
one
its
objects
for
jealousy
had
not
yet
made
her
desperate
her
attentions
to
mr
darcy
were
by
no
means
over
miss
darcy
on
her
brother
s
entrance
exerted
herself
much
more
to
talk
elizabeth
saw
that
he
was
anxious
for
his
sister
herself
to
get
acquainted
forwarded
as
much
as
possible
every
attempt
at
conversation
on
either
side
miss
bingley
saw
likewise
in
imprudence
anger
took
first
opportunity
saying
with
sneering
civility
pray
miss
eliza
not
shire
militia
removed
from
meryton
they
must
be
great
loss
to
your
family
in
darcy
s
presence
she
dared
not
mention
wickham
s
name
but
elizabeth
instantly
comprehended
that
he
was
uppermost
in
her
thoughts
various
recollections
connected
with
him
gave
her
moment
s
distress
but
exerting
herself
vigorously
to
repel
ill
natured
attack
she
presently
answered
question
in
tolerably
detached
tone
while
she
spoke
an
involuntary
glance
showed
her
darcy
with
heightened
complexion
earnestly
looking
at
her
his
sister
overcome
with
confusion
unable
to
lift
up
her
eyes
had
miss
bingley
known
what
pain
she
was
then
giving
her
beloved
friend
she
undoubtedly
would
refrained
from
hint
but
she
had
merely
intended
to
discompose
elizabeth
by
bringing
forward
idea
man
to
whom
she
believed
her
partial
to
make
her
betray
sensibility
which
might
injure
her
in
darcy
s
opinion
perhaps
to
remind
latter
follies
absurdities
by
which
some
part
her
family
were
connected
with
that
corps
not
syllable
had
ever
reached
her
miss
darcy
s
meditated
elopement
to
no
creature
had
been
revealed
where
secrecy
was
possible
except
to
elizabeth
from
bingley
s
connections
her
brother
was
particularly
anxious
to
conceal
from
very
wish
which
elizabeth
had
long
ago
attributed
to
him
their
becoming
hereafter
her
own
he
had
certainly
formed
such
plan
without
meaning
that
effect
his
endeavour
to
separate
him
from
miss
bennet
probable
that
might
add
something
to
his
lively
concern
for
welfare
his
friend
elizabeth
s
collected
behaviour
however
soon
quieted
his
emotion
as
miss
bingley
vexed
disappointed
dared
not
approach
nearer
to
wickham
georgiana
also
recovered
in
time
though
not
enough
to
be
able
to
speak
any
more
her
brother
whose
eye
she
feared
to
meet
scarcely
recollected
her
interest
in
affair
very
circumstance
which
had
been
designed
to
turn
his
thoughts
from
elizabeth
seemed
to
fixed
them
on
her
more
more
cheerfully
their
visit
did
not
continue
long
after
question
answer
above
mentioned
while
mr
darcy
was
attending
them
to
their
carriage
miss
bingley
was
venting
her
feelings
in
criticisms
on
elizabeth
s
person
behaviour
dress
but
georgiana
would
not
join
her
her
brother
s
recommendation
was
enough
to
ensure
her
favour
his
judgement
could
not
err
he
had
spoken
in
such
terms
elizabeth
as
to
leave
georgiana
without
power
finding
her
otherwise
than
lovely
amiable
when
darcy
returned
to
saloon
miss
bingley
could
not
help
repeating
to
him
some
part
what
she
had
been
saying
to
his
sister
how
very
ill
miss
eliza
bennet
looks
morning
mr
darcy
she
cried
never
in
my
life
saw
anyone
so
much
altered
as
she
since
winter
she
grown
so
brown
coarse
louisa
were
agreeing
that
we
not
known
her
again
however
little
mr
darcy
might
liked
such
an
address
he
contented
himself
with
coolly
replying
that
he
perceived
no
other
alteration
than
her
being
rather
tanned
no
miraculous
consequence
travelling
in
summer
for
my
own
part
she
rejoined
must
confess
that
never
could
see
any
beauty
in
her
her
face
too
thin
her
complexion
has
no
brilliancy
her
features
not
at
handsome
her
nose
wants
character
there
nothing
marked
in
its
lines
her
teeth
tolerable
but
not
out
common
way
as
for
her
eyes
which
sometimes
been
called
so
fine
could
never
see
anything
extraordinary
in
them
they
sharp
shrewish
look
which
do
not
like
at
in
her
air
altogether
there
self
sufficiency
without
fashion
which
intolerable
persuaded
as
miss
bingley
was
that
darcy
admired
elizabeth
was
not
best
method
recommending
herself
but
angry
people
not
always
wise
in
seeing
him
at
last
look
somewhat
nettled
she
had
success
she
expected
he
was
resolutely
silent
however
from
determination
making
him
speak
she
continued
remember
when
we
first
knew
her
in
hertfordshire
how
amazed
we
were
to
find
that
she
was
reputed
beauty
particularly
recollect
your
saying
one
night
after
they
had
been
dining
at
netherfield
she
beauty
as
soon
call
her
mother
wit
but
afterwards
she
seemed
to
improve
on
you
believe
you
thought
her
rather
pretty
at
one
time
yes
replied
darcy
who
could
contain
himself
no
longer
but
that
was
only
when
first
saw
her
for
many
months
since
considered
her
as
one
handsomest
women
my
acquaintance
he
then
went
away
miss
bingley
was
left
to
satisfaction
having
forced
him
to
say
what
gave
no
one
any
pain
but
herself
mrs
gardiner
elizabeth
talked
that
had
occurred
during
their
visit
as
they
returned
except
what
had
particularly
interested
them
both
look
behaviour
everybody
they
had
seen
were
discussed
except
person
who
had
mostly
engaged
their
attention
they
talked
his
sister
his
friends
his
house
his
fruit
everything
but
himself
yet
elizabeth
was
longing
to
know
what
mrs
gardiner
thought
him
mrs
gardiner
would
been
highly
gratified
by
her
niece
s
beginning
subject
chapter
elizabeth
had
been
good
deal
disappointed
in
not
finding
letter
from
jane
on
their
first
arrival
at
lambton
disappointment
had
been
renewed
on
each
mornings
that
had
now
been
spent
there
but
on
her
repining
was
over
her
sister
justified
by
receipt
two
letters
from
her
at
once
on
one
which
was
marked
that
had
been
missent
elsewhere
elizabeth
was
not
surprised
at
as
jane
had
written
direction
remarkably
ill
they
had
just
been
preparing
to
walk
as
letters
came
in
her
uncle
aunt
leaving
her
to
enjoy
them
in
quiet
set
off
by
themselves
one
missent
must
first
be
attended
to
had
been
written
five
days
ago
beginning
contained
an
account
their
little
parties
engagements
with
such
news
as
country
afforded
but
latter
half
which
was
dated
day
later
written
in
evident
agitation
gave
more
important
intelligence
was
to
effect
since
writing
above
dearest
lizzy
something
has
occurred
most
unexpected
serious
nature
but
afraid
alarming
you
be
assured
that
we
well
what
to
say
relates
to
poor
lydia
an
express
came
at
twelve
last
night
just
as
we
were
gone
to
bed
from
colonel
forster
to
inform
us
that
she
was
gone
off
to
scotland
with
one
his
officers
to
own
truth
with
wickham
imagine
our
surprise
to
kitty
however
does
not
seem
so
wholly
unexpected
very
very
sorry
so
imprudent
match
on
both
sides
but
willing
to
hope
best
that
his
character
has
been
misunderstood
thoughtless
indiscreet
can
easily
believe
him
but
step
let
us
rejoice
over
marks
nothing
bad
at
heart
his
choice
disinterested
at
least
for
he
must
know
my
father
can
give
her
nothing
our
poor
mother
sadly
grieved
my
father
bears
better
how
thankful
that
we
never
let
them
know
what
has
been
said
against
him
we
must
forget
ourselves
they
were
off
saturday
night
about
twelve
as
conjectured
but
were
not
missed
till
yesterday
morning
at
eight
express
was
sent
off
directly
my
dear
lizzy
they
must
passed
within
ten
miles
us
colonel
forster
gives
us
reason
to
expect
him
here
soon
lydia
left
few
lines
for
his
wife
informing
her
their
intention
must
conclude
for
cannot
be
long
from
my
poor
mother
afraid
you
will
not
be
able
to
make
out
but
hardly
know
what
written
without
allowing
herself
time
for
consideration
scarcely
knowing
what
she
felt
elizabeth
on
finishing
letter
instantly
seized
other
opening
with
utmost
impatience
read
as
follows
had
been
written
day
later
than
conclusion
first
by
time
my
dearest
sister
you
received
my
hurried
letter
wish
may
be
more
intelligible
but
though
not
confined
for
time
my
head
so
bewildered
that
cannot
answer
for
being
coherent
dearest
lizzy
hardly
know
what
would
write
but
bad
news
for
you
cannot
be
delayed
imprudent
as
marriage
between
mr
wickham
our
poor
lydia
would
be
we
now
anxious
to
be
assured
has
taken
place
for
there
but
too
much
reason
to
fear
they
not
gone
to
scotland
colonel
forster
came
yesterday
having
left
brighton
day
before
not
many
hours
after
express
though
lydia
s
short
letter
to
mrs
f
gave
them
to
understand
that
they
were
going
to
gretna
green
something
was
dropped
by
denny
expressing
his
belief
that
w
never
intended
to
go
there
or
to
marry
lydia
at
which
was
repeated
to
colonel
f
who
instantly
taking
alarm
set
off
from
b
intending
to
trace
their
route
he
did
trace
them
easily
to
clapham
but
no
further
for
on
entering
that
place
they
removed
into
hackney
coach
dismissed
chaise
that
brought
them
from
epsom
that
known
after
that
they
were
seen
to
continue
london
road
know
not
what
to
think
after
making
every
possible
inquiry
on
that
side
london
colonel
f
came
on
into
hertfordshire
anxiously
renewing
them
at
turnpikes
at
inns
in
barnet
hatfield
but
without
any
success
no
such
people
had
been
seen
to
pass
through
with
kindest
concern
he
came
on
to
longbourn
broke
his
apprehensions
to
us
in
manner
most
creditable
to
his
heart
sincerely
grieved
for
him
mrs
f
but
no
one
can
throw
any
blame
on
them
our
distress
my
dear
lizzy
very
great
my
father
mother
believe
worst
but
cannot
think
so
ill
him
many
circumstances
might
make
more
eligible
for
them
to
be
married
privately
in
town
than
to
pursue
their
first
plan
even
if
he
could
form
such
design
against
young
woman
lydia
s
connections
which
not
likely
can
suppose
her
so
lost
to
everything
impossible
grieve
to
find
however
that
colonel
f
not
disposed
to
depend
upon
their
marriage
he
shook
his
head
when
expressed
my
hopes
said
he
feared
w
was
not
man
to
be
trusted
my
poor
mother
really
ill
keeps
her
room
could
she
exert
herself
would
be
better
but
not
to
be
expected
as
to
my
father
never
in
my
life
saw
him
so
affected
poor
kitty
has
anger
for
having
concealed
their
attachment
but
as
was
matter
confidence
one
cannot
wonder
truly
glad
dearest
lizzy
that
you
been
spared
something
these
distressing
scenes
but
now
as
first
shock
over
shall
own
that
long
for
your
return
not
so
selfish
however
as
to
press
for
if
inconvenient
adieu
take
up
my
pen
again
to
do
what
just
told
you
would
not
but
circumstances
such
that
cannot
help
earnestly
begging
you
to
come
here
as
soon
as
possible
know
my
dear
uncle
aunt
so
well
that
not
afraid
requesting
though
still
something
more
to
ask
former
my
father
going
to
london
with
colonel
forster
instantly
to
try
to
discover
her
what
he
means
to
do
sure
know
not
but
his
excessive
distress
will
not
allow
him
to
pursue
any
measure
in
best
safest
way
colonel
forster
obliged
to
be
at
brighton
again
to
morrow
evening
in
such
an
exigence
my
uncle
s
advice
assistance
would
be
everything
in
world
he
will
immediately
comprehend
what
must
feel
rely
upon
his
goodness
oh
where
where
my
uncle
cried
elizabeth
darting
from
her
seat
as
she
finished
letter
in
eagerness
to
follow
him
without
losing
moment
time
so
precious
but
as
she
reached
door
was
opened
by
servant
mr
darcy
appeared
her
pale
face
impetuous
manner
made
him
start
before
he
could
recover
himself
to
speak
she
in
whose
mind
every
idea
was
superseded
by
lydia
s
situation
hastily
exclaimed
beg
your
pardon
but
must
leave
you
must
find
mr
gardiner
moment
on
business
that
cannot
be
delayed
not
an
instant
to
lose
good
god
what
matter
cried
he
with
more
feeling
than
politeness
then
recollecting
himself
will
not
detain
you
minute
but
let
me
or
let
servant
go
after
mr
mrs
gardiner
you
not
well
enough
you
cannot
go
yourself
elizabeth
hesitated
but
her
knees
trembled
under
her
she
felt
how
little
would
be
gained
by
her
attempting
to
pursue
them
calling
back
servant
therefore
she
commissioned
him
though
in
so
breathless
an
accent
as
made
her
almost
unintelligible
to
fetch
his
master
mistress
home
instantly
on
his
quitting
room
she
sat
down
unable
to
support
herself
looking
so
miserably
ill
that
was
impossible
for
darcy
to
leave
her
or
to
refrain
from
saying
in
tone
gentleness
commiseration
let
me
call
your
maid
there
nothing
you
could
take
to
give
you
present
relief
glass
wine
shall
get
you
one
you
very
ill
no
thank
you
she
replied
endeavouring
to
recover
herself
there
nothing
matter
with
me
quite
well
only
distressed
by
some
dreadful
news
which
just
received
from
longbourn
she
burst
into
tears
as
she
alluded
to
for
few
minutes
could
not
speak
another
word
darcy
in
wretched
suspense
could
only
say
something
indistinctly
his
concern
observe
her
in
compassionate
silence
at
length
she
spoke
again
just
had
letter
from
jane
with
such
dreadful
news
cannot
be
concealed
from
anyone
my
younger
sister
has
left
her
friends
has
eloped
has
thrown
herself
into
power
mr
wickham
they
gone
off
together
from
brighton
you
know
him
too
well
to
doubt
rest
she
has
no
money
no
connections
nothing
that
can
tempt
him
to
she
lost
for
ever
darcy
was
fixed
in
astonishment
when
consider
she
added
in
yet
more
agitated
voice
that
might
prevented
who
knew
what
he
was
had
but
explained
some
part
only
some
part
what
learnt
to
my
own
family
had
his
character
been
known
could
not
happened
but
too
late
now
grieved
indeed
cried
darcy
grieved
shocked
but
certain
absolutely
certain
oh
yes
they
left
brighton
together
on
sunday
night
were
traced
almost
to
london
but
not
beyond
they
certainly
not
gone
to
scotland
what
has
been
done
what
has
been
attempted
to
recover
her
my
father
gone
to
london
jane
has
written
to
beg
my
uncle
s
immediate
assistance
we
shall
be
off
hope
in
half
an
hour
but
nothing
can
be
done
know
very
well
that
nothing
can
be
done
how
such
man
to
be
worked
on
how
they
even
to
be
discovered
not
smallest
hope
every
way
horrible
darcy
shook
his
head
in
silent
acquiescence
when
my
eyes
were
opened
to
his
real
character
oh
had
known
what
ought
what
dared
to
do
but
knew
not
was
afraid
doing
too
much
wretched
wretched
mistake
darcy
made
no
answer
he
seemed
scarcely
to
hear
her
was
walking
up
down
room
in
earnest
meditation
his
brow
contracted
his
air
gloomy
elizabeth
soon
observed
instantly
understood
her
power
was
sinking
everything
must
sink
under
such
proof
family
weakness
such
an
assurance
deepest
disgrace
she
could
neither
wonder
nor
condemn
but
belief
his
self
conquest
brought
nothing
consolatory
to
her
bosom
afforded
no
palliation
her
distress
was
on
contrary
exactly
calculated
to
make
her
understand
her
own
wishes
never
had
she
so
honestly
felt
that
she
could
loved
him
as
now
when
love
must
be
vain
but
self
though
would
intrude
could
not
engross
her
lydia
humiliation
misery
she
was
bringing
on
them
soon
swallowed
up
every
private
care
covering
her
face
with
her
handkerchief
elizabeth
was
soon
lost
to
everything
else
after
pause
several
minutes
was
only
recalled
to
sense
her
situation
by
voice
her
companion
who
in
manner
which
though
spoke
compassion
spoke
likewise
restraint
said
afraid
you
been
long
desiring
my
absence
nor
anything
to
plead
in
excuse
my
stay
but
real
though
unavailing
concern
would
to
heaven
that
anything
could
be
either
said
or
done
on
my
part
that
might
offer
consolation
to
such
distress
but
will
not
torment
you
with
vain
wishes
which
may
seem
purposely
to
ask
for
your
thanks
unfortunate
affair
will
fear
prevent
my
sister
s
having
pleasure
seeing
you
at
pemberley
to
day
oh
yes
be
so
kind
as
to
apologise
for
us
to
miss
darcy
say
that
urgent
business
calls
us
home
immediately
conceal
unhappy
truth
as
long
as
possible
know
cannot
be
long
he
readily
assured
her
his
secrecy
again
expressed
his
sorrow
for
her
distress
wished
happier
conclusion
than
there
was
at
present
reason
to
hope
leaving
his
compliments
for
her
relations
with
only
one
serious
parting
look
went
away
as
he
quitted
room
elizabeth
felt
how
improbable
was
that
they
ever
see
each
other
again
on
such
terms
cordiality
as
had
marked
their
several
meetings
in
derbyshire
as
she
threw
retrospective
glance
over
whole
their
acquaintance
so
full
contradictions
varieties
sighed
at
perverseness
those
feelings
which
would
now
promoted
its
continuance
would
formerly
rejoiced
in
its
termination
if
gratitude
esteem
good
foundations
affection
elizabeth
s
change
sentiment
will
be
neither
improbable
nor
faulty
but
if
otherwise
if
regard
springing
from
such
sources
unreasonable
or
unnatural
in
comparison
what
so
often
described
as
arising
on
first
interview
with
its
object
even
before
two
words
been
exchanged
nothing
can
be
said
in
her
defence
except
that
she
had
given
somewhat
trial
to
latter
method
in
her
partiality
for
wickham
that
its
ill
success
might
perhaps
authorise
her
to
seek
other
less
interesting
mode
attachment
be
that
as
may
she
saw
him
go
with
regret
in
early
example
what
lydia
s
infamy
must
produce
found
additional
anguish
as
she
reflected
on
that
wretched
business
never
since
reading
jane
s
letter
had
she
entertained
hope
wickham
s
meaning
to
marry
her
no
one
but
jane
she
thought
could
flatter
herself
with
such
an
expectation
surprise
was
least
her
feelings
on
development
while
contents
first
letter
remained
in
her
mind
she
was
surprise
astonishment
that
wickham
marry
girl
whom
was
impossible
he
could
marry
for
money
how
lydia
could
ever
attached
him
had
appeared
incomprehensible
but
now
was
too
natural
for
such
an
attachment
as
she
might
sufficient
charms
though
she
did
not
suppose
lydia
to
be
deliberately
engaging
in
an
elopement
without
intention
marriage
she
had
no
difficulty
in
believing
that
neither
her
virtue
nor
her
understanding
would
preserve
her
from
falling
an
easy
prey
she
had
never
perceived
while
regiment
was
in
hertfordshire
that
lydia
had
any
partiality
for
him
but
she
was
convinced
that
lydia
wanted
only
encouragement
to
attach
herself
to
anybody
sometimes
one
officer
sometimes
another
had
been
her
favourite
as
their
attentions
raised
them
in
her
opinion
her
affections
had
continually
been
fluctuating
but
never
without
an
object
mischief
neglect
mistaken
indulgence
towards
such
girl
oh
how
acutely
did
she
now
feel
she
was
wild
to
be
at
home
to
hear
to
see
to
be
upon
spot
to
share
with
jane
in
cares
that
must
now
fall
wholly
upon
her
in
family
so
deranged
father
absent
mother
incapable
exertion
requiring
constant
attendance
though
almost
persuaded
that
nothing
could
be
done
for
lydia
her
uncle
s
interference
seemed
utmost
importance
till
he
entered
room
her
impatience
was
severe
mr
mrs
gardiner
had
hurried
back
in
alarm
supposing
by
servant
s
account
that
their
niece
was
taken
suddenly
ill
but
satisfying
them
instantly
on
that
head
she
eagerly
communicated
cause
their
summons
reading
two
letters
aloud
dwelling
on
postscript
last
with
trembling
energy
though
lydia
had
never
been
favourite
with
them
mr
mrs
gardiner
could
not
but
be
deeply
afflicted
not
lydia
only
but
were
concerned
in
after
first
exclamations
surprise
horror
mr
gardiner
promised
every
assistance
in
his
power
elizabeth
though
expecting
no
less
thanked
him
with
tears
gratitude
being
actuated
by
one
spirit
everything
relating
to
their
journey
was
speedily
settled
they
were
to
be
off
as
soon
as
possible
but
what
to
be
done
about
pemberley
cried
mrs
gardiner
john
told
us
mr
darcy
was
here
when
you
sent
for
us
was
so
yes
told
him
we
not
be
able
to
keep
our
engagement
that
settled
what
settled
repeated
other
as
she
ran
into
her
room
to
prepare
they
upon
such
terms
as
for
her
to
disclose
real
truth
oh
that
knew
how
was
but
wishes
were
vain
or
at
least
could
only
serve
to
amuse
her
in
hurry
confusion
following
hour
had
elizabeth
been
at
leisure
to
be
idle
she
would
remained
certain
that
employment
was
impossible
to
one
so
wretched
as
herself
but
she
had
her
share
business
as
well
as
her
aunt
amongst
rest
there
were
notes
to
be
written
to
their
friends
at
lambton
with
false
excuses
for
their
sudden
departure
an
hour
however
saw
whole
completed
mr
gardiner
meanwhile
having
settled
his
account
at
inn
nothing
remained
to
be
done
but
to
go
elizabeth
after
misery
morning
found
herself
in
shorter
space
time
than
she
could
supposed
seated
in
carriage
on
road
to
longbourn
chapter
been
thinking
over
again
elizabeth
said
her
uncle
as
they
drove
from
town
really
upon
serious
consideration
much
more
inclined
than
was
to
judge
as
your
eldest
sister
does
on
matter
appears
to
me
so
very
unlikely
that
any
young
man
form
such
design
against
girl
who
by
no
means
unprotected
or
friendless
who
was
actually
staying
in
his
colonel
s
family
that
strongly
inclined
to
hope
best
could
he
expect
that
her
friends
would
not
step
forward
could
he
expect
to
be
noticed
again
by
regiment
after
such
an
affront
to
colonel
forster
his
temptation
not
adequate
to
risk
do
you
really
think
so
cried
elizabeth
brightening
up
for
moment
upon
my
word
said
mrs
gardiner
begin
to
be
your
uncle
s
opinion
really
too
great
violation
decency
honour
interest
for
him
to
be
guilty
cannot
think
so
very
ill
wickham
can
you
yourself
lizzy
so
wholly
give
him
up
as
to
believe
him
capable
not
perhaps
neglecting
his
own
interest
but
every
other
neglect
can
believe
him
capable
if
indeed
be
so
but
dare
not
hope
why
they
not
go
on
to
scotland
if
that
had
been
case
in
first
place
replied
mr
gardiner
there
no
absolute
proof
that
they
not
gone
to
scotland
oh
but
their
removing
from
chaise
into
hackney
coach
such
presumption
besides
no
traces
them
were
to
be
found
on
barnet
road
well
then
supposing
them
to
be
in
london
they
may
be
there
though
for
purpose
concealment
for
no
more
exceptional
purpose
not
likely
that
money
be
very
abundant
on
either
side
might
strike
them
that
they
could
be
more
economically
though
less
expeditiously
married
in
london
than
in
scotland
but
why
secrecy
why
any
fear
detection
why
must
their
marriage
be
private
oh
no
no
not
likely
his
most
particular
friend
you
see
by
jane
s
account
was
persuaded
his
never
intending
to
marry
her
wickham
will
never
marry
woman
without
some
money
he
cannot
afford
what
claims
has
lydia
what
attraction
has
she
beyond
youth
health
good
humour
that
could
make
him
for
her
sake
forego
every
chance
benefiting
himself
by
marrying
well
as
to
what
restraint
apprehensions
disgrace
in
corps
might
throw
on
dishonourable
elopement
with
her
not
able
to
judge
for
know
nothing
effects
that
such
step
might
produce
but
as
to
your
other
objection
afraid
will
hardly
hold
good
lydia
has
no
brothers
to
step
forward
he
might
imagine
from
my
father
s
behaviour
from
his
indolence
little
attention
he
has
ever
seemed
to
give
to
what
was
going
forward
in
his
family
that
he
would
do
as
little
think
as
little
about
as
any
father
could
do
in
such
matter
but
can
you
think
that
lydia
so
lost
to
everything
but
love
him
as
to
consent
to
live
with
him
on
any
terms
other
than
marriage
does
seem
most
shocking
indeed
replied
elizabeth
with
tears
in
her
eyes
that
sister
s
sense
decency
virtue
in
such
point
admit
doubt
but
really
know
not
what
to
say
perhaps
not
doing
her
justice
but
she
very
young
she
has
never
been
taught
to
think
on
serious
subjects
for
last
half
year
nay
for
twelvemonth
she
has
been
given
up
to
nothing
but
amusement
vanity
she
has
been
allowed
to
dispose
her
time
in
most
idle
frivolous
manner
to
adopt
any
opinions
that
came
in
her
way
since
shire
were
first
quartered
in
meryton
nothing
but
love
flirtation
officers
been
in
her
head
she
has
been
doing
everything
in
her
power
by
thinking
talking
on
subject
to
give
greater
what
shall
call
susceptibility
to
her
feelings
which
naturally
lively
enough
we
know
that
wickham
has
every
charm
person
address
that
can
captivate
woman
but
you
see
that
jane
said
her
aunt
does
not
think
so
very
ill
wickham
as
to
believe
him
capable
attempt
whom
does
jane
ever
think
ill
who
there
whatever
might
be
their
former
conduct
that
she
would
think
capable
such
an
attempt
till
were
proved
against
them
but
jane
knows
as
well
as
do
what
wickham
really
we
both
know
that
he
has
been
profligate
in
every
sense
word
that
he
has
neither
integrity
nor
honour
that
he
as
false
deceitful
as
he
insinuating
do
you
really
know
cried
mrs
gardiner
whose
curiosity
as
to
mode
her
intelligence
was
alive
do
indeed
replied
elizabeth
colouring
told
you
other
day
his
infamous
behaviour
to
mr
darcy
you
yourself
when
last
at
longbourn
heard
in
what
manner
he
spoke
man
who
had
behaved
with
such
forbearance
liberality
towards
him
there
other
circumstances
which
not
at
liberty
which
not
worth
while
to
relate
but
his
lies
about
whole
pemberley
family
endless
from
what
he
said
miss
darcy
was
thoroughly
prepared
to
see
proud
reserved
disagreeable
girl
yet
he
knew
to
contrary
himself
he
must
know
that
she
was
as
amiable
unpretending
as
we
found
her
but
does
lydia
know
nothing
can
she
be
ignorant
what
you
jane
seem
so
well
to
understand
oh
yes
that
that
worst
till
was
in
kent
saw
so
much
both
mr
darcy
his
relation
colonel
fitzwilliam
was
ignorant
truth
myself
when
returned
home
shire
was
to
leave
meryton
in
week
or
fortnight
s
time
as
that
was
case
neither
jane
to
whom
related
whole
nor
thought
necessary
to
make
our
knowledge
public
for
what
use
could
apparently
be
to
any
one
that
good
opinion
which
neighbourhood
had
him
then
be
overthrown
even
when
was
settled
that
lydia
go
with
mrs
forster
necessity
opening
her
eyes
to
his
character
never
occurred
to
me
that
she
could
be
in
any
danger
from
deception
never
entered
my
head
that
such
consequence
as
could
ensue
you
may
easily
believe
was
far
enough
from
my
thoughts
when
they
removed
to
brighton
therefore
you
had
no
reason
suppose
to
believe
them
fond
each
other
not
slightest
can
remember
no
symptom
affection
on
either
side
had
anything
kind
been
perceptible
you
must
be
aware
that
ours
not
family
on
which
could
be
thrown
away
when
first
he
entered
corps
she
was
ready
enough
to
admire
him
but
so
we
were
every
girl
in
or
near
meryton
was
out
her
senses
about
him
for
first
two
months
but
he
never
distinguished
her
by
any
particular
attention
consequently
after
moderate
period
extravagant
wild
admiration
her
fancy
for
him
gave
way
others
regiment
who
treated
her
with
more
distinction
again
became
her
favourites
may
be
easily
believed
that
however
little
novelty
could
be
added
to
their
fears
hopes
conjectures
on
interesting
subject
by
its
repeated
discussion
no
other
could
detain
them
from
long
during
whole
journey
from
elizabeth
s
thoughts
was
never
absent
fixed
there
by
keenest
anguish
self
reproach
she
could
find
no
interval
ease
or
forgetfulness
they
travelled
as
expeditiously
as
possible
sleeping
one
night
on
road
reached
longbourn
by
dinner
time
next
day
was
comfort
to
elizabeth
to
consider
that
jane
could
not
been
wearied
by
long
expectations
little
gardiners
attracted
by
sight
chaise
were
standing
on
steps
house
as
they
entered
paddock
when
carriage
drove
up
to
door
joyful
surprise
that
lighted
up
their
faces
displayed
itself
over
their
whole
bodies
in
variety
capers
frisks
was
first
pleasing
earnest
their
welcome
elizabeth
jumped
out
after
giving
each
them
hasty
kiss
hurried
into
vestibule
where
jane
who
came
running
down
from
her
mother
s
apartment
immediately
met
her
elizabeth
as
she
affectionately
embraced
her
whilst
tears
filled
eyes
both
lost
not
moment
in
asking
whether
anything
had
been
heard
fugitives
not
yet
replied
jane
but
now
that
my
dear
uncle
come
hope
everything
will
be
well
my
father
in
town
yes
he
went
on
tuesday
as
wrote
you
word
you
heard
from
him
often
we
heard
only
twice
he
wrote
me
few
lines
on
wednesday
to
say
that
he
had
arrived
in
safety
to
give
me
his
directions
which
particularly
begged
him
to
do
he
merely
added
that
he
not
write
again
till
he
had
something
importance
to
mention
my
mother
how
she
how
you
my
mother
tolerably
well
trust
though
her
spirits
greatly
shaken
she
upstairs
will
great
satisfaction
in
seeing
you
she
does
not
yet
leave
her
dressing
room
mary
kitty
thank
heaven
quite
well
but
you
how
you
cried
elizabeth
you
look
pale
how
much
you
must
gone
through
her
sister
however
assured
her
her
being
perfectly
well
their
conversation
which
had
been
passing
while
mr
mrs
gardiner
were
engaged
with
their
children
was
now
put
an
end
to
by
approach
whole
party
jane
ran
to
her
uncle
aunt
welcomed
thanked
them
both
with
alternate
smiles
tears
when
they
were
in
drawing
room
questions
which
elizabeth
had
already
asked
were
course
repeated
by
others
they
soon
found
that
jane
had
no
intelligence
to
give
sanguine
hope
good
however
which
benevolence
her
heart
suggested
had
not
yet
deserted
her
she
still
expected
that
would
end
well
that
every
morning
would
bring
some
letter
either
from
lydia
or
her
father
to
explain
their
proceedings
perhaps
announce
their
marriage
mrs
bennet
to
whose
apartment
they
repaired
after
few
minutes
conversation
together
received
them
exactly
as
might
be
expected
with
tears
lamentations
regret
invectives
against
villainous
conduct
wickham
complaints
her
own
sufferings
ill
usage
blaming
everybody
but
person
to
whose
ill
judging
indulgence
errors
her
daughter
must
principally
be
owing
if
had
been
able
said
she
to
carry
my
point
in
going
to
brighton
with
my
family
would
not
happened
but
poor
dear
lydia
had
nobody
to
take
care
her
why
did
forsters
ever
let
her
go
out
their
sight
sure
there
was
some
great
neglect
or
other
on
their
side
for
she
not
kind
girl
to
do
such
thing
if
she
had
been
well
looked
after
always
thought
they
were
very
unfit
to
charge
her
but
was
overruled
as
always
poor
dear
child
now
here
s
mr
bennet
gone
away
know
he
will
fight
wickham
wherever
he
meets
him
then
he
will
be
killed
what
to
become
us
collinses
will
turn
us
out
before
he
cold
in
his
grave
if
you
not
kind
to
us
brother
do
not
know
what
we
shall
do
they
exclaimed
against
such
terrific
ideas
mr
gardiner
after
general
assurances
his
affection
for
her
her
family
told
her
that
he
meant
to
be
in
london
very
next
day
would
assist
mr
bennet
in
every
endeavour
for
recovering
lydia
do
not
give
way
to
useless
alarm
added
he
though
right
to
be
prepared
for
worst
there
no
occasion
to
look
on
as
certain
not
quite
week
since
they
left
brighton
in
few
days
more
we
may
gain
some
news
them
till
we
know
that
they
not
married
no
design
marrying
do
not
let
us
give
matter
over
as
lost
as
soon
as
get
to
town
shall
go
to
my
brother
make
him
come
home
with
me
to
gracechurch
street
then
we
may
consult
together
as
to
what
to
be
done
oh
my
dear
brother
replied
mrs
bennet
that
exactly
what
could
most
wish
for
now
do
when
you
get
to
town
find
them
out
wherever
they
may
be
if
they
not
married
already
make
them
marry
as
for
wedding
clothes
do
not
let
them
wait
for
that
but
tell
lydia
she
shall
as
much
money
as
she
chooses
to
buy
them
after
they
married
above
keep
mr
bennet
from
fighting
tell
him
what
dreadful
state
in
that
frighted
out
my
wits
such
tremblings
such
flutterings
over
me
such
spasms
in
my
side
pains
in
my
head
such
beatings
at
heart
that
can
get
no
rest
by
night
nor
by
day
tell
my
dear
lydia
not
to
give
any
directions
about
her
clothes
till
she
has
seen
me
for
she
does
not
know
which
best
warehouses
oh
brother
how
kind
you
know
you
will
contrive
but
mr
gardiner
though
he
assured
her
again
his
earnest
endeavours
in
cause
could
not
avoid
recommending
moderation
to
her
as
well
in
her
hopes
as
her
fear
after
talking
with
her
in
manner
till
dinner
was
on
table
they
left
her
to
vent
her
feelings
on
housekeeper
who
attended
in
absence
her
daughters
though
her
brother
sister
were
persuaded
that
there
was
no
real
occasion
for
such
seclusion
from
family
they
did
not
attempt
to
oppose
for
they
knew
that
she
had
not
prudence
enough
to
hold
her
tongue
before
servants
while
they
waited
at
table
judged
better
that
one
only
household
one
whom
they
could
most
trust
comprehend
her
fears
solicitude
on
subject
in
dining
room
they
were
soon
joined
by
mary
kitty
who
had
been
too
busily
engaged
in
their
separate
apartments
to
make
their
appearance
before
one
came
from
her
books
other
from
her
toilette
faces
both
however
were
tolerably
calm
no
change
was
visible
in
either
except
that
loss
her
favourite
sister
or
anger
which
she
had
herself
incurred
in
business
had
given
more
fretfulness
than
usual
to
accents
kitty
as
for
mary
she
was
mistress
enough
herself
to
whisper
to
elizabeth
with
countenance
grave
reflection
soon
after
they
were
seated
at
table
most
unfortunate
affair
will
probably
be
much
talked
but
we
must
stem
tide
malice
pour
into
wounded
bosoms
each
other
balm
sisterly
consolation
then
perceiving
in
elizabeth
no
inclination
replying
she
added
unhappy
as
event
must
be
for
lydia
we
may
draw
from
useful
lesson
that
loss
virtue
in
female
irretrievable
that
one
false
step
involves
her
in
endless
ruin
that
her
reputation
no
less
brittle
than
beautiful
that
she
cannot
be
too
much
guarded
in
her
behaviour
towards
undeserving
other
sex
elizabeth
lifted
up
her
eyes
in
amazement
but
was
too
much
oppressed
to
make
any
reply
mary
however
continued
to
console
herself
with
such
kind
moral
extractions
from
evil
before
them
in
afternoon
two
elder
miss
bennets
were
able
to
be
for
half
an
hour
by
themselves
elizabeth
instantly
availed
herself
opportunity
making
any
inquiries
which
jane
was
equally
eager
to
satisfy
after
joining
in
general
lamentations
over
dreadful
sequel
event
which
elizabeth
considered
as
but
certain
miss
bennet
could
not
assert
to
be
wholly
impossible
former
continued
subject
by
saying
but
tell
me
everything
about
which
not
already
heard
give
me
further
particulars
what
did
colonel
forster
say
had
they
no
apprehension
anything
before
elopement
took
place
they
must
seen
them
together
for
ever
colonel
forster
did
own
that
he
had
often
suspected
some
partiality
especially
on
lydia
s
side
but
nothing
to
give
him
any
alarm
so
grieved
for
him
his
behaviour
was
attentive
kind
to
utmost
he
was
coming
to
us
in
order
to
assure
us
his
concern
before
he
had
any
idea
their
not
being
gone
to
scotland
when
that
apprehension
first
got
abroad
hastened
his
journey
was
denny
convinced
that
wickham
would
not
marry
did
he
know
their
intending
to
go
off
had
colonel
forster
seen
denny
himself
yes
but
when
questioned
by
him
denny
denied
knowing
anything
their
plans
would
not
give
his
real
opinion
about
he
did
not
repeat
his
persuasion
their
not
marrying
from
that
inclined
to
hope
he
might
been
misunderstood
before
till
colonel
forster
came
himself
not
one
you
entertained
doubt
suppose
their
being
really
married
how
was
possible
that
such
an
idea
enter
our
brains
felt
little
uneasy
little
fearful
my
sister
s
happiness
with
him
in
marriage
because
knew
that
his
conduct
had
not
been
always
quite
right
my
father
mother
knew
nothing
that
they
only
felt
how
imprudent
match
must
be
kitty
then
owned
with
very
natural
triumph
on
knowing
more
than
rest
us
that
in
lydia
s
last
letter
she
had
prepared
her
for
such
step
she
had
known
seems
their
being
in
love
with
each
other
many
weeks
but
not
before
they
went
to
brighton
no
believe
not
did
colonel
forster
appear
to
think
well
wickham
himself
does
he
know
his
real
character
must
confess
that
he
did
not
speak
so
well
wickham
as
he
formerly
did
he
believed
him
to
be
imprudent
extravagant
since
sad
affair
has
taken
place
said
that
he
left
meryton
greatly
in
debt
but
hope
may
be
false
oh
jane
had
we
been
less
secret
had
we
told
what
we
knew
him
could
not
happened
perhaps
would
been
better
replied
her
sister
but
to
expose
former
faults
any
person
without
knowing
what
their
present
feelings
were
seemed
unjustifiable
we
acted
with
best
intentions
could
colonel
forster
repeat
particulars
lydia
s
note
to
his
wife
he
brought
with
him
for
us
to
see
jane
then
took
from
her
pocket
book
gave
to
elizabeth
these
were
contents
my
dear
harriet
you
will
laugh
when
you
know
where
gone
cannot
help
laughing
myself
at
your
surprise
to
morrow
morning
as
soon
as
missed
going
to
gretna
green
if
you
cannot
guess
with
who
shall
think
you
simpleton
for
there
but
one
man
in
world
love
he

angel

be
happy
without
him
so
think
no
harm
to
be
off
you
need
not
send
them
word
at
longbourn
my
going
if
you
do
not
like
for
will
make
surprise
greater
when
write
to
them
sign
my
name
lydia
wickham
what
good
joke
will
be
can
hardly
write
for
laughing
pray
make
my
excuses
to
pratt
for
not
keeping
my
engagement
dancing
with
him
to
night
tell
him
hope
he
will
excuse
me
when
he
knows
tell
him
will
dance
with
him
at
next
ball
we
meet
with
great
pleasure
shall
send
for
my
clothes
when
get
to
longbourn
but
wish
you
would
tell
sally
to
mend
great
slit
in
my
worked
muslin
gown
before
they
packed
up
good
bye
give
my
love
to
colonel
forster
hope
you
will
drink
to
our
good
journey
your
affectionate
friend
lydia
bennet
oh
thoughtless
thoughtless
lydia
cried
elizabeth
when
she
had
finished
what
letter
to
be
written
at
such
moment
but
at
least
shows
that
she
was
serious
on
subject
their
journey
whatever
he
might
afterwards
persuade
her
to
was
not
on
her
side
scheme
infamy
my
poor
father
how
he
must
felt
never
saw
anyone
so
shocked
he
could
not
speak
word
for
full
ten
minutes
my
mother
was
taken
ill
immediately
whole
house
in
such
confusion
oh
jane
cried
elizabeth
was
there
servant
belonging
to
who
did
not
know
whole
story
before
end
day
do
not
know
hope
there
was
but
to
be
guarded
at
such
time
very
difficult
my
mother
was
in
hysterics
though
endeavoured
to
give
her
every
assistance
in
my
power
afraid
did
not
do
so
much
as
might
done
but
horror
what
might
possibly
happen
almost
took
from
me
my
faculties
your
attendance
upon
her
has
been
too
much
for
you
you
do
not
look
well
oh
that
had
been
with
you
you
had
every
care
anxiety
upon
yourself
alone
mary
kitty
been
very
kind
would
shared
in
every
fatigue
sure
but
did
not
think
right
for
either

slight
delicate
mary
studies
so
much
that
her
hours
repose
not
be
broken
in
on
my
aunt
phillips
came
to
longbourn
on
tuesday
after
my
father
went
away
was
so
good
as
to
stay
till
thursday
with
me
she
was
great
use
comfort
to
us
lady
lucas
has
been
very
kind
she
walked
here
on
wednesday
morning
to
condole
with
us
offered
her
services
or
any
her
daughters
if
they
be
use
to
us
she
had
better
stayed
at
home
cried
elizabeth
perhaps
she
meant
well
but
under
such
misfortune
as
one
cannot
see
too
little
one
s
neighbours
assistance
impossible
condolence
insufferable
let
them
triumph
over
us
at
distance
be
satisfied
she
then
proceeded
to
inquire
into
measures
which
her
father
had
intended
to
pursue
while
in
town
for
recovery
his
daughter
he
meant
believe
replied
jane
to
go
to
epsom
place
where
they
last
changed
horses
see
postilions
try
if
anything
could
be
made
out
from
them
his
principal
object
must
be
to
discover
number
hackney
coach
which
took
them
from
clapham
had
come
with
fare
from
london
as
he
thought
that
circumstance
gentleman
lady
s
removing
from
one
carriage
into
another
might
be
remarked
he
meant
to
make
inquiries
at
clapham
if
he
could
anyhow
discover
at
what
house
coachman
had
before
set
down
his
fare
he
determined
to
make
inquiries
there
hoped
might
not
be
impossible
to
find
out
stand
number
coach
do
not
know
any
other
designs
that
he
had
formed
but
he
was
in
such
hurry
to
be
gone
his
spirits
so
greatly
discomposed
that
had
difficulty
in
finding
out
even
so
much
as
chapter
whole
party
were
in
hopes
letter
from
mr
bennet
next
morning
but
post
came
in
without
bringing
single
line
from
him
his
family
knew
him
to
be
on
common
occasions
most
negligent
dilatory
correspondent
but
at
such
time
they
had
hoped
for
exertion
they
were
forced
to
conclude
that
he
had
no
pleasing
intelligence
to
send
but
even
that
they
would
been
glad
to
be
certain
mr
gardiner
had
waited
only
for
letters
before
he
set
off
when
he
was
gone
they
were
certain
at
least
receiving
constant
information
what
was
going
on
their
uncle
promised
at
parting
to
prevail
on
mr
bennet
to
return
to
longbourn
as
soon
as
he
could
to
great
consolation
his
sister
who
considered
as
only
security
for
her
husband
s
not
being
killed
in
duel
mrs
gardiner
children
were
to
remain
in
hertfordshire
few
days
longer
as
former
thought
her
presence
might
be
serviceable
to
her
nieces
she
shared
in
their
attendance
on
mrs
bennet
was
great
comfort
to
them
in
their
hours
freedom
their
other
aunt
also
visited
them
frequently
always
as
she
said
with
design
cheering
heartening
them
up
though
as
she
never
came
without
reporting
some
fresh
instance
wickham
s
extravagance
or
irregularity
she
seldom
went
away
without
leaving
them
more
dispirited
than
she
found
them
meryton
seemed
striving
to
blacken
man
who
but
months
before
had
been
almost
an
angel
light
he
was
declared
to
be
in
debt
to
every
tradesman
in
place
his
intrigues
honoured
with
title
seduction
had
been
extended
into
every
tradesman
s
family
everybody
declared
that
he
was
wickedest
young
man
in
world
everybody
began
to
find
out
that
they
had
always
distrusted
appearance
his
goodness
elizabeth
though
she
did
not
credit
above
half
what
was
said
believed
enough
to
make
her
former
assurance
her
sister
s
ruin
more
certain
even
jane
who
believed
still
less
became
almost
hopeless
more
especially
as
time
was
now
come
when
if
they
had
gone
to
scotland
which
she
had
never
before
entirely
despaired
they
must
in
probability
gained
some
news
them
mr
gardiner
left
longbourn
on
sunday
on
tuesday
his
wife
received
letter
from
him
told
them
that
on
his
arrival
he
had
immediately
found
out
his
brother
persuaded
him
to
come
to
gracechurch
street
that
mr
bennet
had
been
to
epsom
clapham
before
his
arrival
but
without
gaining
any
satisfactory
information
that
he
was
now
determined
to
inquire
at
principal
hotels
in
town
as
mr
bennet
thought
possible
they
might
gone
to
one
them
on
their
first
coming
to
london
before
they
procured
lodgings
mr
gardiner
himself
did
not
expect
any
success
from
measure
but
as
his
brother
was
eager
in
he
meant
to
assist
him
in
pursuing
he
added
that
mr
bennet
seemed
wholly
disinclined
at
present
to
leave
london
promised
to
write
again
very
soon
there
was
also
postscript
to
effect
written
to
colonel
forster
to
desire
him
to
find
out
if
possible
from
some
young
man
s
intimates
in
regiment
whether
wickham
has
any
relations
or
connections
who
would
be
likely
to
know
in
what
part
town
he
has
now
concealed
himself
if
there
were
anyone
that
one
could
apply
to
with
probability
gaining
such
clue
as
that
might
be
essential
consequence
at
present
we
nothing
to
guide
us
colonel
forster
will
dare
say
do
everything
in
his
power
to
satisfy
us
on
head
but
on
thoughts
perhaps
lizzy
could
tell
us
what
relations
he
has
now
living
better
than
any
other
person
elizabeth
was
at
no
loss
to
understand
from
whence
deference
to
her
authority
proceeded
but
was
not
in
her
power
to
give
any
information
so
satisfactory
nature
as
compliment
deserved
she
had
never
heard
his
having
had
any
relations
except
father
mother
both
whom
had
been
dead
many
years
was
possible
however
that
some
his
companions
in
shire
might
be
able
to
give
more
information
though
she
was
not
very
sanguine
in
expecting
application
was
something
to
look
forward
to
every
day
at
longbourn
was
now
day
anxiety
but
most
anxious
part
each
was
when
post
was
expected
arrival
letters
was
grand
object
every
morning
s
impatience
through
letters
whatever
good
or
bad
was
to
be
told
would
be
communicated
every
succeeding
day
was
expected
to
bring
some
news
importance
but
before
they
heard
again
from
mr
gardiner
letter
arrived
for
their
father
from
different
quarter
from
mr
collins
which
as
jane
had
received
directions
to
open
that
came
for
him
in
his
absence
she
accordingly
read
elizabeth
who
knew
what
curiosities
his
letters
always
were
looked
over
her
read
likewise
was
as
follows
my
dear
sir
feel
myself
called
upon
by
our
relationship
my
situation
in
life
to
condole
with
you
on
grievous
affliction
you
now
suffering
under
which
we
were
yesterday
informed
by
letter
from
hertfordshire
be
assured
my
dear
sir
that
mrs
collins
myself
sincerely
sympathise
with
you
your
respectable
family
in
your
present
distress
which
must
be
bitterest
kind
because
proceeding
from
cause
which
no
time
can
remove
no
arguments
shall
be
wanting
on
my
part
that
can
alleviate
so
severe
misfortune
or
that
may
comfort
you
under
circumstance
that
must
be
others
most
afflicting
to
parent
s
mind
death
your
daughter
would
been
blessing
in
comparison
more
to
be
lamented
because
there
reason
to
suppose
as
my
dear
charlotte
informs
me
that
licentiousness
behaviour
in
your
daughter
has
proceeded
from
faulty
degree
indulgence
though
at
same
time
for
consolation
yourself
mrs
bennet
inclined
to
think
that
her
own
disposition
must
be
naturally
bad
or
she
could
not
be
guilty
such
an
enormity
at
so
early
an
age
howsoever
that
may
be
you
grievously
to
be
pitied
in
which
opinion
not
only
joined
by
mrs
collins
but
likewise
by
lady
catherine
her
daughter
to
whom
related
affair
they
agree
with
me
in
apprehending
that
false
step
in
one
daughter
will
be
injurious
to
fortunes
others
for
who
as
lady
catherine
herself
condescendingly
says
will
connect
themselves
with
such
family
consideration
leads
me
moreover
to
reflect
with
augmented
satisfaction
on
certain
event
last
november
for
had
been
otherwise
must
been
involved
in
your
sorrow
disgrace
let
me
then
advise
you
dear
sir
to
console
yourself
as
much
as
possible
to
throw
off
your
unworthy
child
from
your
affection
for
ever
leave
her
to
reap
fruits
her
own
heinous
offense
dear
sir
etc
etc
mr
gardiner
did
not
write
again
till
he
had
received
an
answer
from
colonel
forster
then
he
had
nothing
pleasant
nature
to
send
was
not
known
that
wickham
had
single
relationship
with
whom
he
kept
up
any
connection
was
certain
that
he
had
no
near
one
living
his
former
acquaintances
had
been
numerous
but
since
he
had
been
in
militia
did
not
appear
that
he
was
on
terms
particular
friendship
with
any
them
there
was
no
one
therefore
who
could
be
pointed
out
as
likely
to
give
any
news
him
in
wretched
state
his
own
finances
there
was
very
powerful
motive
for
secrecy
in
addition
to
his
fear
discovery
by
lydia
s
relations
for
had
just
transpired
that
he
had
left
gaming
debts
behind
him
to
very
considerable
amount
colonel
forster
believed
that
more
than
thousand
pounds
would
be
necessary
to
clear
his
expenses
at
brighton
he
owed
good
deal
in
town
but
his
debts
honour
were
still
more
formidable
mr
gardiner
did
not
attempt
to
conceal
these
particulars
from
longbourn
family
jane
heard
them
with
horror
gamester
she
cried
wholly
unexpected
had
not
an
idea
mr
gardiner
added
in
his
letter
that
they
might
expect
to
see
their
father
at
home
on
following
day
which
was
saturday
rendered
spiritless
by
ill
success
their
endeavours
he
had
yielded
to
his
brother
in
law
s
entreaty
that
he
would
return
to
his
family
leave
to
him
to
do
whatever
occasion
might
suggest
to
be
advisable
for
continuing
their
pursuit
when
mrs
bennet
was
told
she
did
not
express
so
much
satisfaction
as
her
children
expected
considering
what
her
anxiety
for
his
life
had
been
before
what
he
coming
home
without
poor
lydia
she
cried
sure
he
will
not
leave
london
before
he
has
found
them
who
to
fight
wickham
make
him
marry
her
if
he
comes
away
as
mrs
gardiner
began
to
wish
to
be
at
home
was
settled
that
she
children
go
to
london
at
same
time
that
mr
bennet
came
from
coach
therefore
took
them
first
stage
their
journey
brought
its
master
back
to
longbourn
mrs
gardiner
went
away
in
perplexity
about
elizabeth
her
derbyshire
friend
that
had
attended
her
from
that
part
world
his
name
had
never
been
voluntarily
mentioned
before
them
by
her
niece
kind
half
expectation
which
mrs
gardiner
had
formed
their
being
followed
by
letter
from
him
had
ended
in
nothing
elizabeth
had
received
none
since
her
return
that
could
come
from
pemberley
present
unhappy
state
family
rendered
any
other
excuse
for
lowness
her
spirits
unnecessary
nothing
therefore
could
be
fairly
conjectured
from
that
though
elizabeth
who
was
by
time
tolerably
well
acquainted
with
her
own
feelings
was
perfectly
aware
that
had
she
known
nothing
darcy
she
could
borne
dread
lydia
s
infamy
somewhat
better
would
spared
her
she
thought
one
sleepless
night
out
two
when
mr
bennet
arrived
he
had
appearance
his
usual
philosophic
composure
he
said
as
little
as
he
had
ever
been
in
habit
saying
made
no
mention
business
that
had
taken
him
away
was
some
time
before
his
daughters
had
courage
to
speak
was
not
till
afternoon
when
he
had
joined
them
at
tea
that
elizabeth
ventured
to
introduce
subject
then
on
her
briefly
expressing
her
sorrow
for
what
he
must
endured
he
replied
say
nothing
that
who
suffer
but
myself
has
been
my
own
doing
ought
to
feel
you
must
not
be
too
severe
upon
yourself
replied
elizabeth
you
may
well
warn
me
against
such
an
evil
human
nature
so
prone
to
fall
into
no
lizzy
let
me
once
in
my
life
feel
how
much
been
to
blame
not
afraid
being
overpowered
by
impression
will
pass
away
soon
enough
do
you
suppose
them
to
be
in
london
yes
where
else
can
they
be
so
well
concealed
lydia
used
to
want
to
go
to
london
added
kitty
she
happy
then
said
her
father
drily
her
residence
there
will
probably
be
some
duration
then
after
short
silence
he
continued
lizzy
bear
you
no
ill
will
for
being
justified
in
your
advice
to
me
last
may
which
considering
event
shows
some
greatness
mind
they
were
interrupted
by
miss
bennet
who
came
to
fetch
her
mother
s
tea
parade
he
cried
which
does
one
good
gives
such
an
elegance
to
misfortune
another
day
will
do
same
will
sit
in
my
library
in
my
nightcap
powdering
gown
give
as
much
trouble
as
can
or
perhaps
may
defer
till
kitty
runs
away
not
going
to
run
away
papa
said
kitty
fretfully
if
ever
go
to
brighton
would
behave
better
than
lydia
you
go
to
brighton
would
not
trust
you
so
near
as
eastbourne
for
fifty
pounds
no
kitty
at
last
learnt
to
be
cautious
you
will
feel
effects
no
officer
ever
to
enter
into
my
house
again
nor
even
to
pass
through
village
balls
will
be
absolutely
prohibited
unless
you
stand
up
with
one
your
sisters
you
never
to
stir
out
doors
till
you
can
prove
that
you
spent
ten
minutes
every
day
in
rational
manner
kitty
who
took
these
threats
in
serious
light
began
to
cry
well
well
said
he
do
not
make
yourself
unhappy
if
you
good
girl
for
next
ten
years
will
take
you
to
review
at
end
them
chapter
two
days
after
mr
bennet
s
return
as
jane
elizabeth
were
walking
together
in
shrubbery
behind
house
they
saw
housekeeper
coming
towards
them
concluding
that
she
came
to
call
them
to
their
mother
went
forward
to
meet
her
but
instead
expected
summons
when
they
approached
her
she
said
to
miss
bennet
beg
your
pardon
madam
for
interrupting
you
but
was
in
hopes
you
might
got
some
good
news
from
town
so
took
liberty
coming
to
ask
what
do
you
mean
hill
we
heard
nothing
from
town
dear
madam
cried
mrs
hill
in
great
astonishment
don
t
you
know
there
an
express
come
for
master
from
mr
gardiner
he
has
been
here
half
hour
master
has
had
letter
away
ran
girls
too
eager
to
get
in
to
time
for
speech
they
ran
through
vestibule
into
breakfast
room
from
thence
to
library
their
father
was
in
neither
they
were
on
point
seeking
him
upstairs
with
their
mother
when
they
were
met
by
butler
who
said
if
you
looking
for
my
master
ma
he
walking
towards
little
copse
upon
information
they
instantly
passed
through
hall
once
more
ran
across
lawn
after
their
father
who
was
deliberately
pursuing
his
way
towards
small
wood
on
one
side
paddock
jane
who
was
not
so
light
nor
so
much
in
habit
running
as
elizabeth
soon
lagged
behind
while
her
sister
panting
for
breath
came
up
with
him
eagerly
cried
out
oh
papa
what
news
what
news
you
heard
from
my
uncle
yes
had
letter
from
him
by
express
well
what
news
does
bring
good
or
bad
what
there
good
to
be
expected
said
he
taking
letter
from
his
pocket
but
perhaps
you
would
like
to
read
elizabeth
impatiently
caught
from
his
hand
jane
now
came
up
read
aloud
said
their
father
for
hardly
know
myself
what
about
gracechurch
street
monday
august
my
dear
brother
at
last
able
to
send
you
some
tidings
my
niece
such
as
upon
whole
hope
will
give
you
satisfaction
soon
after
you
left
me
on
saturday
was
fortunate
enough
to
find
out
in
what
part
london
they
were
particulars
reserve
till
we
meet
enough
to
know
they
discovered
seen
them
both
then
as
always
hoped
cried
jane
they
married
elizabeth
read
on
seen
them
both
they
not
married
nor
can
find
there
was
any
intention
being
so
but
if
you
willing
to
perform
engagements
which
ventured
to
make
on
your
side
hope
will
not
be
long
before
they
that
required
you
to
assure
to
your
daughter
by
settlement
her
equal
share
five
thousand
pounds
secured
among
your
children
after
decease
yourself
my
sister
moreover
to
enter
into
an
engagement
allowing
her
during
your
life
one
hundred
pounds
per
annum

conditions

everything
had
no
hesitation
in
complying
with
as
far
as
thought

privileged
for
you
shall
send
by
express
that
no
time
may
be
lost
in
bringing
me
your
answer
you
will
easily
comprehend
from
these
particulars
that
mr
wickham
s
circumstances
not
so
hopeless
as
they
generally
believed
to
be
world
has
been
deceived
in
that
respect
happy
to
say
there
will
be
some
little
money
even
when
his
debts
discharged
to
settle
on
my
niece
in
addition
to
her
own
fortune

as
conclude
will
be

your
name

business

immediately
give
directions
to

on
my
diligence
care

back
your
answer
as
fast
as
you
can
be
careful
to
write
explicitly
we
judged
best
that
my
niece
be
married
from
house
which
hope
you
will
approve
she
comes
to
us
to
day
shall
write
again
as
soon
as
anything
more
determined
on
yours
etc
edw
gardiner
possible
cried
elizabeth
when
she
had
finished
can
be
possible
that
he
will
marry
her
wickham
not
so
undeserving
then
as
we
thought
him
said
her
sister
my
dear
father
congratulate
you
you
answered
letter
cried
elizabeth
no
but
must
be
done
soon
most
earnestly
did
she
then
entreaty
him
to
lose
no
more
time
before
he
wrote
oh
my
dear
father
she
cried
come
back
write
immediately
consider
how
important
every
moment
in
such
case
let
me
write
for
you
said
jane
if
you
dislike
trouble
yourself
dislike
very
much
he
replied
but
must
be
done
so
saying
he
turned
back
with
them
walked
towards
house
may
ask
said
elizabeth
but
terms
suppose
must
be
complied
with
complied
with
only
ashamed
his
asking
so
little
they
must
marry
yet
he
such
man
yes
yes
they
must
marry
there
nothing
else
to
be
done
but
there
two
things
that
want
very
much
to
know
one
how
much
money
your
uncle
has
laid
down
to
bring
about
other
how
ever
to
pay
him
money
my
uncle
cried
jane
what
do
you
mean
sir
mean
that
no
man
in
his
senses
would
marry
lydia
on
so
slight
temptation
as
one
hundred
year
during
my
life
fifty
after
gone
that
very
true
said
elizabeth
though
had
not
occurred
to
me
before
his
debts
to
be
discharged
something
still
to
remain
oh
must
be
my
uncle
s
doings
generous
good
man
afraid
he
has
distressed
himself
small
sum
could
not
do
no
said
her
father
wickham
s
fool
if
he
takes
her
with
farthing
less
than
ten
thousand
pounds
be
sorry
to
think
so
ill
him
in
very
beginning
our
relationship
ten
thousand
pounds
heaven
forbid
how
half
such
sum
to
be
repaid
mr
bennet
made
no
answer
each
them
deep
in
thought
continued
silent
till
they
reached
house
their
father
then
went
on
to
library
to
write
girls
walked
into
breakfast
room
they
really
to
be
married
cried
elizabeth
as
soon
as
they
were
by
themselves
how
strange
for
we
to
be
thankful
that
they
marry
small
as
their
chance
happiness
wretched
as
his
character
we
forced
to
rejoice
oh
lydia
comfort
myself
with
thinking
replied
jane
that
he
certainly
would
not
marry
lydia
if
he
had
not
real
regard
for
her
though
our
kind
uncle
has
done
something
towards
clearing
him
cannot
believe
that
ten
thousand
pounds
or
anything
like
has
been
advanced
he
has
children
his
own
may
more
how
could
he
spare
half
ten
thousand
pounds
if
he
were
ever
able
to
learn
what
wickham
s
debts
been
said
elizabeth
how
much
settled
on
his
side
on
our
sister
we
shall
exactly
know
what
mr
gardiner
has
done
for
them
because
wickham
has
not
sixpence
his
own
kindness
my
uncle
aunt
can
never
be
requited
their
taking
her
home
affording
her
their
personal
protection
countenance
such
sacrifice
to
her
advantage
as
years
gratitude
cannot
enough
acknowledge
by
time
she
actually
with
them
if
such
goodness
does
not
make
her
miserable
now
she
will
never
deserve
to
be
happy
what
meeting
for
her
when
she
first
sees
my
aunt
we
must
endeavour
to
forget
that
has
passed
on
either
side
said
jane
hope
trust
they
will
yet
be
happy
his
consenting
to
marry
her
proof
will
believe
that
he
come
to
right
way
thinking
their
mutual
affection
will
steady
them
flatter
myself
they
will
settle
so
quietly
live
in
so
rational
manner
as
may
in
time
make
their
past
imprudence
forgotten
their
conduct
has
been
such
replied
elizabeth
as
neither
you
nor
nor
anybody
can
ever
forget
useless
to
talk
now
occurred
to
girls
that
their
mother
was
in
likelihood
perfectly
ignorant
what
had
happened
they
went
to
library
therefore
asked
their
father
whether
he
would
not
wish
them
to
make
known
to
her
he
was
writing
without
raising
his
head
coolly
replied
just
as
you
please
may
we
take
my
uncle
s
letter
to
read
to
her
take
whatever
you
like
get
away
elizabeth
took
letter
from
his
writing
table
they
went
upstairs
together
mary
kitty
were
both
with
mrs
bennet
one
communication
would
therefore
do
for
after
slight
preparation
for
good
news
letter
was
read
aloud
mrs
bennet
could
hardly
contain
herself
as
soon
as
jane
had
read
mr
gardiner
s
hope
lydia
s
being
soon
married
her
joy
burst
forth
every
following
sentence
added
to
its
exuberance
she
was
now
in
an
irritation
as
violent
from
delight
as
she
had
ever
been
fidgety
from
alarm
vexation
to
know
that
her
daughter
would
be
married
was
enough
she
was
disturbed
by
no
fear
for
her
felicity
nor
humbled
by
any
remembrance
her
misconduct
my
dear
dear
lydia
she
cried
delightful
indeed
she
will
be
married
shall
see
her
again
she
will
be
married
at
sixteen
my
good
kind
brother
knew
how
would
be
knew
he
would
manage
everything
how
long
to
see
her
to
see
dear
wickham
too
but
clothes
wedding
clothes
will
write
to
my
sister
gardiner
about
them
directly
lizzy
my
dear
run
down
to
your
father
ask
him
how
much
he
will
give
her
stay
stay
will
go
myself
ring
bell
kitty
for
hill
will
put
on
my
things
in
moment
my
dear
dear
lydia
how
merry
we
shall
be
together
when
we
meet
her
eldest
daughter
endeavoured
to
give
some
relief
to
violence
these
transports
by
leading
her
thoughts
to
obligations
which
mr
gardiner
s
behaviour
laid
them
under
for
we
must
attribute
happy
conclusion
she
added
in
great
measure
to
his
kindness
we
persuaded
that
he
has
pledged
himself
to
assist
mr
wickham
with
money
well
cried
her
mother
very
right
who
do
but
her
own
uncle
if
he
had
not
had
family
his
own
my
children
must
had
his
money
you
know
first
time
we
ever
had
anything
from
him
except
few
presents
well
so
happy
in
short
time
shall
daughter
married
mrs
wickham
how
well
sounds
she
was
only
sixteen
last
june
my
dear
jane
in
such
flutter
that
sure
can
t
write
so
will
dictate
you
write
for
me
we
will
settle
with
your
father
about
money
afterwards
but
things
be
ordered
immediately
she
was
then
proceeding
to
particulars
calico
muslin
cambric
would
shortly
dictated
some
very
plentiful
orders
had
not
jane
though
with
some
difficulty
persuaded
her
to
wait
till
her
father
was
at
leisure
to
be
consulted
one
day
s
delay
she
observed
would
be
small
importance
her
mother
was
too
happy
to
be
quite
so
obstinate
as
usual
other
schemes
too
came
into
her
head
will
go
to
meryton
said
she
as
soon
as
dressed
tell
good
good
news
to
my
sister
philips
as
come
back
can
call
on
lady
lucas
mrs
long
kitty
run
down
order
carriage
an
airing
would
do
me
great
deal
good
sure
girls
can
do
anything
for
you
in
meryton
oh
here
comes
hill
my
dear
hill
you
heard
good
news
miss
lydia
going
to
be
married
you
shall
bowl
punch
to
make
merry
at
her
wedding
mrs
hill
began
instantly
to
express
her
joy
elizabeth
received
her
congratulations
amongst
rest
then
sick
folly
took
refuge
in
her
own
room
that
she
might
think
with
freedom
poor
lydia
s
situation
must
at
best
be
bad
enough
but
that
was
no
worse
she
had
need
to
be
thankful
she
felt
so
though
in
looking
forward
neither
rational
happiness
nor
worldly
prosperity
could
be
justly
expected
for
her
sister
in
looking
back
to
what
they
had
feared
only
two
hours
ago
she
felt
advantages
what
they
had
gained
chapter
mr
bennet
had
very
often
wished
before
period
his
life
that
instead
spending
his
whole
income
he
had
laid
by
an
annual
sum
for
better
provision
his
children
his
wife
if
she
survived
him
he
now
wished
more
than
ever
had
he
done
his
duty
in
that
respect
lydia
need
not
been
indebted
to
her
uncle
for
whatever
honour
or
credit
could
now
be
purchased
for
her
satisfaction
prevailing
on
one
most
worthless
young
men
in
great
britain
to
be
her
husband
might
then
rested
in
its
proper
place
he
was
seriously
concerned
that
cause
so
little
advantage
to
anyone
be
forwarded
at
sole
expense
his
brother
in
law
he
was
determined
if
possible
to
find
out
extent
his
assistance
to
discharge
obligation
as
soon
as
he
could
when
first
mr
bennet
had
married
economy
was
held
to
be
perfectly
useless
for
course
they
were
to
son
son
was
to
join
in
cutting
off
entail
as
soon
as
he
be
age
widow
younger
children
would
by
that
means
be
provided
for
five
daughters
successively
entered
world
but
yet
son
was
to
come
mrs
bennet
for
many
years
after
lydia
s
birth
had
been
certain
that
he
would
event
had
at
last
been
despaired
but
was
then
too
late
to
be
saving
mrs
bennet
had
no
turn
for
economy
her
husband
s
love
independence
had
alone
prevented
their
exceeding
their
income
five
thousand
pounds
was
settled
by
marriage
articles
on
mrs
bennet
children
but
in
what
proportions
be
divided
amongst
latter
depended
on
will
parents
was
one
point
with
regard
to
lydia
at
least
which
was
now
to
be
settled
mr
bennet
could
no
hesitation
in
acceding
to
proposal
before
him
in
terms
grateful
acknowledgment
for
kindness
his
brother
though
expressed
most
concisely
he
then
delivered
on
paper
his
perfect
approbation
that
was
done
his
willingness
to
fulfil
engagements
that
had
been
made
for
him
he
had
never
before
supposed
that
could
wickham
be
prevailed
on
to
marry
his
daughter
would
be
done
with
so
little
inconvenience
to
himself
as
by
present
arrangement
he
would
scarcely
be
ten
pounds
year
loser
by
hundred
that
was
to
be
paid
them
for
what
with
her
board
pocket
allowance
continual
presents
in
money
which
passed
to
her
through
her
mother
s
hands
lydia
s
expenses
had
been
very
little
within
that
sum
that
would
be
done
with
such
trifling
exertion
on
his
side
too
was
another
very
welcome
surprise
for
his
wish
at
present
was
to
as
little
trouble
in
business
as
possible
when
first
transports
rage
which
had
produced
his
activity
in
seeking
her
were
over
he
naturally
returned
to
his
former
indolence
his
letter
was
soon
dispatched
for
though
dilatory
in
undertaking
business
he
was
quick
in
its
execution
he
begged
to
know
further
particulars
what
he
was
indebted
to
his
brother
but
was
too
angry
with
lydia
to
send
any
message
to
her
good
news
spread
quickly
through
house
with
proportionate
speed
through
neighbourhood
was
borne
in
latter
with
decent
philosophy
to
be
sure
would
been
more
for
advantage
conversation
had
miss
lydia
bennet
come
upon
town
or
as
happiest
alternative
been
secluded
from
world
in
some
distant
farmhouse
but
there
was
much
to
be
talked
in
marrying
her
good
natured
wishes
for
her
well
doing
which
had
proceeded
before
from
spiteful
old
ladies
in
meryton
lost
but
little
their
spirit
in
change
circumstances
because
with
such
an
husband
her
misery
was
considered
certain
was
fortnight
since
mrs
bennet
had
been
downstairs
but
on
happy
day
she
again
took
her
seat
at
head
her
table
in
spirits
oppressively
high
no
sentiment
shame
gave
damp
to
her
triumph
marriage
daughter
which
had
been
first
object
her
wishes
since
jane
was
sixteen
was
now
on
point
accomplishment
her
thoughts
her
words
ran
wholly
on
those
attendants
elegant
nuptials
fine
muslins
new
carriages
servants
she
was
busily
searching
through
neighbourhood
for
proper
situation
for
her
daughter
without
knowing
or
considering
what
their
income
might
be
rejected
many
as
deficient
in
size
importance
haye
park
might
do
said
she
if
gouldings
could
quit
or
great
house
at
stoke
if
drawing
room
were
larger
but
ashworth
too
far
off
could
not
bear
to
her
ten
miles
from
me
as
for
pulvis
lodge
attics
dreadful
her
husband
allowed
her
to
talk
on
without
interruption
while
servants
remained
but
when
they
had
withdrawn
he
said
to
her
mrs
bennet
before
you
take
any
or
these
houses
for
your
son
daughter
let
us
come
to
right
understanding
into
one
house
in
neighbourhood
they
shall
never
admittance
will
not
encourage
impudence
either
by
receiving
them
at
longbourn
long
dispute
followed
declaration
but
mr
bennet
was
firm
soon
led
to
another
mrs
bennet
found
with
amazement
horror
that
her
husband
would
not
advance
guinea
to
buy
clothes
for
his
daughter
he
protested
that
she
receive
from
him
no
mark
affection
whatever
on
occasion
mrs
bennet
could
hardly
comprehend
that
his
anger
could
be
carried
to
such
point
inconceivable
resentment
as
to
refuse
his
daughter
privilege
without
which
her
marriage
would
scarcely
seem
valid
exceeded
she
could
believe
possible
she
was
more
alive
to
disgrace
which
her
want
new
clothes
must
reflect
on
her
daughter
s
nuptials
than
to
any
sense
shame
at
her
eloping
living
with
wickham
fortnight
before
they
took
place
elizabeth
was
now
most
heartily
sorry
that
she
had
from
distress
moment
been
led
to
make
mr
darcy
acquainted
with
their
fears
for
her
sister
for
since
her
marriage
would
so
shortly
give
proper
termination
to
elopement
they
might
hope
to
conceal
its
unfavourable
beginning
from
those
who
were
not
immediately
on
spot
she
had
no
fear
its
spreading
farther
through
his
means
there
were
few
people
on
whose
secrecy
she
would
more
confidently
depended
but
at
same
time
there
was
no
one
whose
knowledge
sister
s
frailty
would
mortified
her
so
much
not
however
from
any
fear
disadvantage
from
individually
to
herself
for
at
any
rate
there
seemed
gulf
impassable
between
them
had
lydia
s
marriage
been
concluded
on
most
honourable
terms
was
not
to
be
supposed
that
mr
darcy
would
connect
himself
with
family
where
to
every
other
objection
would
now
be
added
an
alliance
relationship
nearest
kind
with
man
whom
he
so
justly
scorned
from
such
connection
she
could
not
wonder
that
he
would
shrink
wish
procuring
her
regard
which
she
had
assured
herself
his
feeling
in
derbyshire
could
not
in
rational
expectation
survive
such
blow
as
she
was
humbled
she
was
grieved
she
repented
though
she
hardly
knew
what
she
became
jealous
his
esteem
when
she
could
no
longer
hope
to
be
benefited
by
she
wanted
to
hear
him
when
there
seemed
least
chance
gaining
intelligence
she
was
convinced
that
she
could
been
happy
with
him
when
was
no
longer
likely
they
meet
what
triumph
for
him
as
she
often
thought
could
he
know
that
proposals
which
she
had
proudly
spurned
only
four
months
ago
would
now
been
most
gladly
gratefully
received
he
was
as
generous
she
doubted
not
as
most
generous
his
sex
but
while
he
was
mortal
there
must
be
triumph
she
began
now
to
comprehend
that
he
was
exactly
man
who
in
disposition
talents
would
most
suit
her
his
understanding
temper
though
unlike
her
own
would
answered
her
wishes
was
an
union
that
must
been
to
advantage
both
by
her
ease
liveliness
his
mind
might
been
softened
his
manners
improved
from
his
judgement
information
knowledge
world
she
must
received
benefit
greater
importance
but
no
such
happy
marriage
could
now
teach
admiring
multitude
what
connubial
felicity
really
was
an
union
different
tendency
precluding
possibility
other
was
soon
to
be
formed
in
their
family
how
wickham
lydia
were
to
be
supported
in
tolerable
independence
she
could
not
imagine
but
how
little
permanent
happiness
could
belong
to
couple
who
were
only
brought
together
because
their
passions
were
stronger
than
their
virtue
she
could
easily
conjecture
mr
gardiner
soon
wrote
again
to
his
brother
to
mr
bennet
s
acknowledgments
he
briefly
replied
with
assurance
his
eagerness
to
promote
welfare
any
his
family
concluded
with
entreaties
that
subject
might
never
be
mentioned
to
him
again
principal
purport
his
letter
was
to
inform
them
that
mr
wickham
had
resolved
on
quitting
militia
was
greatly
my
wish
that
he
do
so
he
added
as
soon
as
his
marriage
was
fixed
on
think
you
will
agree
with
me
in
considering
removal
from
that
corps
as
highly
advisable
both
on
his
account
my
niece
s
mr
wickham
s
intention
to
go
into
regulars
among
his
former
friends
there
still
some
who
able
willing
to
assist
him
in
army
he
has
promise
an
ensigncy
in
general
s
regiment
now
quartered
in
north
an
advantage
to
so
far
from
part
kingdom
he
promises
fairly
hope
among
different
people
where
they
may
each
character
to
preserve
they
will
both
be
more
prudent
written
to
colonel
forster
to
inform
him
our
present
arrangements
to
request
that
he
will
satisfy
various
creditors
mr
wickham
in
near
brighton
with
assurances
speedy
payment
for
which
pledged
myself
will
you
give
yourself
trouble
carrying
similar
assurances
to
his
creditors
in
meryton
whom
shall
subjoin

according
to
his
information
he
has
given
in
his
debts

at

he
has
not
deceived
us
haggerston
has
our
directions
will
be
completed
in
week
they
will
then
join
his
regiment
unless
they
first
invited
to
longbourn
understand
from
mrs
gardiner
that
my
niece
very
desirous
seeing
you
before
she
leaves
south
she
well
begs
to
be
dutifully
remembered
to
you
your
mother
yours
etc
e
gardiner
mr
bennet
his
daughters
saw
advantages
wickham
s
removal
from
shire
as
clearly
as
mr
gardiner
could
do
but
mrs
bennet
was
not
so
well
pleased
with
lydia
s
being
settled
in
north
just
when
she
had
expected
most
pleasure
pride
in
her
company
for
she
had
by
no
means
given
up
her
plan
their
residing
in
hertfordshire
was
severe
disappointment
besides
was
such
pity
that
lydia
be
taken
from
regiment
where
she
was
acquainted
with
everybody
had
so
many
favourites
she
so
fond
mrs
forster
said
she
will
be
quite
shocking
to
send
her
away
there
several
young
men
too
that
she
likes
very
much
officers
may
not
be
so
pleasant
in
general
s
regiment
his
daughter
s
request
for
such
might
be
considered
being
admitted
into
her
family
again
before
she
set
off
for
north
received
at
first
an
absolute
negative
but
jane
elizabeth
who
agreed
in
wishing
for
sake
their
sister
s
feelings
consequence
that
she
be
noticed
on
her
marriage
by
her
parents
urged
him
so
earnestly
yet
so
rationally
so
mildly
to
receive
her
her
husband
at
longbourn
as
soon
as
they
were
married
that
he
was
prevailed
on
to
think
as
they
thought
act
as
they
wished
their
mother
had
satisfaction
knowing
that
she
would
be
able
to
show
her
married
daughter
in
neighbourhood
before
she
was
banished
to
north
when
mr
bennet
wrote
again
to
his
brother
therefore
he
sent
his
permission
for
them
to
come
was
settled
that
as
soon
as
ceremony
was
over
they
proceed
to
longbourn
elizabeth
was
surprised
however
that
wickham
consent
to
such
scheme
had
she
consulted
only
her
own
inclination
any
meeting
with
him
would
been
last
object
her
wishes
chapter
their
sister
s
wedding
day
arrived
jane
elizabeth
felt
for
her
probably
more
than
she
felt
for
herself
carriage
was
sent
to
meet
them
at
they
were
to
return
in
by
dinner
time
their
arrival
was
dreaded
by
elder
miss
bennets
jane
more
especially
who
gave
lydia
feelings
which
would
attended
herself
had
she
been
culprit
was
wretched
in
thought
what
her
sister
must
endure
they
came
family
were
assembled
in
breakfast
room
to
receive
them
smiles
decked
face
mrs
bennet
as
carriage
drove
up
to
door
her
husband
looked
impenetrably
grave
her
daughters
alarmed
anxious
uneasy
lydia
s
voice
was
heard
in
vestibule
door
was
thrown
open
she
ran
into
room
her
mother
stepped
forwards
embraced
her
welcomed
her
with
rapture
gave
her
hand
with
an
affectionate
smile
to
wickham
who
followed
his
lady
wished
them
both
joy
with
an
alacrity
which
shewed
no
doubt
their
happiness
their
reception
from
mr
bennet
to
whom
they
then
turned
was
not
quite
so
cordial
his
countenance
rather
gained
in
austerity
he
scarcely
opened
his
lips
easy
assurance
young
couple
indeed
was
enough
to
provoke
him
elizabeth
was
disgusted
even
miss
bennet
was
shocked
lydia
was
lydia
still
untamed
unabashed
wild
noisy
fearless
she
turned
from
sister
to
sister
demanding
their
congratulations
when
at
length
they
sat
down
looked
eagerly
round
room
took
notice
some
little
alteration
in
observed
with
laugh
that
was
great
while
since
she
had
been
there
wickham
was
not
at
more
distressed
than
herself
but
his
manners
were
always
so
pleasing
that
had
his
character
his
marriage
been
exactly
what
they
ought
his
smiles
his
easy
address
while
he
claimed
their
relationship
would
delighted
them
elizabeth
had
not
before
believed
him
quite
equal
to
such
assurance
but
she
sat
down
resolving
within
herself
to
draw
no
limits
in
future
to
impudence
an
impudent
man
she
blushed
jane
blushed
but
cheeks
two
who
caused
their
confusion
suffered
no
variation
colour
there
was
no
want
discourse
bride
her
mother
could
neither
them
talk
fast
enough
wickham
who
happened
to
sit
near
elizabeth
began
inquiring
after
his
acquaintance
in
that
neighbourhood
with
good
humoured
ease
which
she
felt
very
unable
to
equal
in
her
replies
they
seemed
each
them
to
happiest
memories
in
world
nothing
past
was
recollected
with
pain
lydia
led
voluntarily
to
subjects
which
her
sisters
would
not
alluded
to
for
world
only
think
its
being
months
she
cried
since
went
away
seems
but
fortnight
declare
yet
there
been
things
enough
happened
in
time
good
gracious
when
went
away
sure
had
no
more
idea
being
married
till
came
back
again
though
thought
would
be
very
good
fun
if
was
her
father
lifted
up
his
eyes
jane
was
distressed
elizabeth
looked
expressively
at
lydia
but
she
who
never
heard
nor
saw
anything
which
she
chose
to
be
insensible
gaily
continued
oh
mamma
do
people
hereabouts
know
married
to
day
was
afraid
they
might
not
we
overtook
william
goulding
in
his
curricle
so
was
determined
he
know
so
let
down
side
glass
next
to
him
took
off
my
glove
let
my
hand
just
rest
upon
window
frame
so
that
he
might
see
ring
then
bowed
smiled
like
anything
elizabeth
could
bear
no
longer
she
got
up
ran
out
room
returned
no
more
till
she
heard
them
passing
through
hall
to
dining
parlour
she
then
joined
them
soon
enough
to
see
lydia
with
anxious
parade
walk
up
to
her
mother
s
right
hand
hear
her
say
to
her
eldest
sister
ah
jane
take
your
place
now
you
must
go
lower
because
married
woman
was
not
to
be
supposed
that
time
would
give
lydia
that
embarrassment
from
which
she
had
been
so
wholly
at
first
her
ease
good
spirits
increased
she
longed
to
see
mrs
phillips
lucases
their
other
neighbours
to
hear
herself
called
mrs
wickham
by
each
them
in
mean
time
she
went
after
dinner
to
show
her
ring
boast
being
married
to
mrs
hill
two
housemaids
well
mamma
said
she
when
they
were
returned
to
breakfast
room
what
do
you
think
my
husband
not
he
charming
man
sure
my
sisters
must
envy
me
only
hope
they
may
half
my
good
luck
they
must
go
to
brighton
that
place
to
get
husbands
what
pity
mamma
we
did
not
go
very
true
if
had
my
will
we
but
my
dear
lydia
don
t
at
like
your
going
such
way
off
must
be
so
oh
lord
yes
there
nothing
in
that
shall
like
things
you
papa
my
sisters
must
come
down
see
us
we
shall
be
at
newcastle
winter
dare
say
there
will
be
some
balls
will
take
care
to
get
good
partners
for
them
like
beyond
anything
said
her
mother
then
when
you
go
away
you
may
leave
one
or
two
my
sisters
behind
you
dare
say
shall
get
husbands
for
them
before
winter
over
thank
you
for
my
share
favour
said
elizabeth
but
do
not
particularly
like
your
way
getting
husbands
their
visitors
were
not
to
remain
above
ten
days
with
them
mr
wickham
had
received
his
commission
before
he
left
london
he
was
to
join
his
regiment
at
end
fortnight
no
one
but
mrs
bennet
regretted
that
their
stay
would
be
so
short
she
made
most
time
by
visiting
about
with
her
daughter
having
very
frequent
parties
at
home
these
parties
were
acceptable
to
to
avoid
family
circle
was
even
more
desirable
to
such
as
did
think
than
such
as
did
not
wickham
s
affection
for
lydia
was
just
what
elizabeth
had
expected
to
find
not
equal
to
lydia
s
for
him
she
had
scarcely
needed
her
present
observation
to
be
satisfied
from
reason
things
that
their
elopement
had
been
brought
on
by
strength
her
love
rather
than
by
his
she
would
wondered
why
without
violently
caring
for
her
he
chose
to
elope
with
her
at
had
she
not
felt
certain
that
his
flight
was
rendered
necessary
by
distress
circumstances
if
that
were
case
he
was
not
young
man
to
resist
an
opportunity
having
companion
lydia
was
exceedingly
fond
him
he
was
her
dear
wickham
on
every
occasion
no
one
was
to
be
put
in
competition
with
him
he
did
every
thing
best
in
world
she
was
sure
he
would
kill
more
birds
on
first
september
than
any
body
else
in
country
one
morning
soon
after
their
arrival
as
she
was
sitting
with
her
two
elder
sisters
she
said
to
elizabeth
lizzy
never
gave
you
an
account
my
wedding
believe
you
were
not
by
when
told
mamma
others
about
not
you
curious
to
hear
how
was
managed
no
really
replied
elizabeth
think
there
cannot
be
too
little
said
on
subject
la
you
so
strange
but
must
tell
you
how
went
off
we
were
married
you
know
at
st
clement
s
because
wickham
s
lodgings
were
in
that
parish
was
settled
that
we
be
there
by
eleven
o
clock
my
uncle
aunt
were
to
go
together
others
were
to
meet
us
at
church
well
monday
morning
came
was
in
such
fuss
was
so
afraid
you
know
that
something
would
happen
to
put
off
then
gone
quite
distracted
there
was
my
aunt
time
was
dressing
preaching
talking
away
just
as
if
she
was
reading
sermon
however
did
not
hear
above
one
word
in
ten
for
was
thinking
you
may
suppose
my
dear
wickham
longed
to
know
whether
he
would
be
married
in
his
blue
coat
well
so
we
breakfasted
at
ten
as
usual
thought
would
never
be
over
for
by
bye
you
to
understand
that
my
uncle
aunt
were
horrid
unpleasant
time
was
with
them
if
you
ll
believe
me
did
not
once
put
my
foot
out
doors
though
was
there
fortnight
not
one
party
or
scheme
or
anything
to
be
sure
london
was
rather
thin
but
however
little
theatre
was
open
well
so
just
as
carriage
came
to
door
my
uncle
was
called
away
upon
business
to
that
horrid
man
mr
stone
then
you
know
when
once
they
get
together
there
no
end
well
was
so
frightened
did
not
know
what
to
do
for
my
uncle
was
to
give
me
away
if
we
were
beyond
hour
we
could
not
be
married
day
but
luckily
he
came
back
again
in
ten
minutes
time
then
we
set
out
however
recollected
afterwards
that
if
he
had
been
prevented
going
wedding
need
not
be
put
off
for
mr
darcy
might
done
as
well
mr
darcy
repeated
elizabeth
in
utter
amazement
oh
yes
he
was
to
come
there
with
wickham
you
know
but
gracious
me
quite
forgot
ought
not
to
said
word
about
promised
them
so
faithfully
what
will
wickham
say
was
to
be
such
secret
if
was
to
be
secret
said
jane
say
not
another
word
on
subject
you
may
depend
upon
my
seeking
no
further
oh
certainly
said
elizabeth
though
burning
with
curiosity
we
will
ask
you
no
questions
thank
you
said
lydia
for
if
you
did
certainly
tell
you
then
wickham
would
be
angry
on
such
encouragement
to
ask
elizabeth
was
forced
to
put
out
her
power
by
running
away
but
to
live
in
ignorance
on
such
point
was
impossible
or
at
least
was
impossible
not
to
try
for
information
mr
darcy
had
been
at
her
sister
s
wedding
was
exactly
scene
exactly
among
people
where
he
had
apparently
least
to
do
least
temptation
to
go
conjectures
as
to
meaning
rapid
wild
hurried
into
her
brain
but
she
was
satisfied
with
none
those
that
best
pleased
her
as
placing
his
conduct
in
noblest
light
seemed
most
improbable
she
could
not
bear
such
suspense
hastily
seizing
sheet
paper
wrote
short
letter
to
her
aunt
to
request
an
explanation
what
lydia
had
dropt
if
were
compatible
with
secrecy
which
had
been
intended
you
may
readily
comprehend
she
added
what
my
curiosity
must
be
to
know
how
person
unconnected
with
any
us
comparatively
speaking
stranger
to
our
family
been
amongst
you
at
such
time
pray
write
instantly
let
me
understand
unless
for
very
cogent
reasons
to
remain
in
secrecy
which
lydia
seems
to
think
necessary
then
must
endeavour
to
be
satisfied
with
ignorance
not
that
shall
though
she
added
to
herself
as
she
finished
letter
my
dear
aunt
if
you
do
not
tell
me
in
an
honourable
manner
shall
certainly
be
reduced
to
tricks
stratagems
to
find
out
jane
s
delicate
sense
honour
would
not
allow
her
to
speak
to
elizabeth
privately
what
lydia
had
let
fall
elizabeth
was
glad
till
appeared
whether
her
inquiries
would
receive
any
satisfaction
she
had
rather
be
without
confidante
chapter
elizabeth
had
satisfaction
receiving
an
answer
to
her
letter
as
soon
as
she
possibly
could
she
was
no
sooner
in
possession
than
hurrying
into
little
copse
where
she
was
least
likely
to
be
interrupted
she
sat
down
on
one
benches
prepared
to
be
happy
for
length
letter
convinced
her
that
did
not
contain
denial
gracechurch
street
sept
my
dear
niece
just
received
your
letter
shall
devote
whole
morning
to
answering
as
foresee
that
little
writing
will
not
comprise
what
to
tell
you
must
confess
myself
surprised
by
your
application
did
not
expect
from
you
don
t
think
me
angry
however
for
only
mean
to
let
you
know
that
had
not
imagined
such
inquiries
to
be
necessary
on
your
side
if
you
do
not
choose
to
understand
me
forgive
my
impertinence
your
uncle
as
much
surprised
as
nothing
but
belief
your
being
party
concerned
would
allowed
him
to
act
as
he
has
done
but
if
you
really
innocent
ignorant
must
be
more
explicit
on
very
day
my
coming
home
from
longbourn
your
uncle
had
most
unexpected
visitor
mr
darcy
called
was
shut
up
with
him
several
hours
was
over
before
arrived
so
my
curiosity
was
not
so
dreadfully
racked
as
your
s
seems
to
been
he
came
to
tell
mr
gardiner
that
he
had
found
out
where
your
sister
mr
wickham
were
that
he
had
seen
talked
with
them
both
wickham
repeatedly
lydia
once
from
what
can
collect
he
left
derbyshire
only
one
day
after
ourselves
came
to
town
with
resolution
hunting
for
them
motive
professed
was
his
conviction
its
being
owing
to
himself
that
wickham
s
worthlessness
had
not
been
so
well
known
as
to
make
impossible
for
any
young
woman
character
to
love
or
confide
in
him
he
generously
imputed
whole
to
his
mistaken
pride
confessed
that
he
had
before
thought
beneath
him
to
lay
his
private
actions
open
to
world
his
character
was
to
speak
for
itself
he
called
therefore
his
duty
to
step
forward
endeavour
to
remedy
an
evil
which
had
been
brought
on
by
himself
if
he
had
another
motive
sure
would
never
disgrace
him
he
had
been
some
days
in
town
before
he
was
able
to
discover
them
but
he
had
something
to
direct
his
search
which
was
more
than
we
had
consciousness
was
another
reason
for
his
resolving
to
follow
us
there
lady
seems
mrs
younge
who
was
some
time
ago
governess
to
miss
darcy
was
dismissed
from
her
charge
on
some
cause
disapprobation
though
he
did
not
say
what
she
then
took
large
house
in
edward
street
has
since
maintained
herself
by
letting
lodgings
mrs
younge
was
he
knew
intimately
acquainted
with
wickham
he
went
to
her
for
intelligence
him
as
soon
as
he
got
to
town
but
was
two
or
days
before
he
could
get
from
her
what
he
wanted
she
would
not
betray
her
trust
suppose
without
bribery
corruption
for
she
really
did
know
where
her
friend
was
to
be
found
wickham
indeed
had
gone
to
her
on
their
first
arrival
in
london
had
she
been
able
to
receive
them
into
her
house
they
would
taken
up
their
abode
with
her
at
length
however
our
kind
friend
procured
wished
for
direction
they
were
in
street
he
saw
wickham
afterwards
insisted
on
seeing
lydia
his
first
object
with
her
he
acknowledged
had
been
to
persuade
her
to
quit
her
present
disgraceful
situation
return
to
her
friends
as
soon
as
they
could
be
prevailed
on
to
receive
her
offering
his
assistance
as
far
as
would
go
but
he
found
lydia
absolutely
resolved
on
remaining
where
she
was
she
cared
for
none
her
friends
she
wanted
no
help
his
she
would
not
hear
leaving
wickham
she
was
sure
they
be
married
some
time
or
other
did
not
much
signify
when
since
such
were
her
feelings
only
remained
he
thought
to
secure
expedite
marriage
which
in
his
very
first
conversation
with
wickham
he
easily
learnt
had
never
been
his
design
he
confessed
himself
obliged
to
leave
regiment
on
account
some
debts
honour
which
were
very
pressing
scrupled
not
to
lay
ill
consequences
lydia
s
flight
on
her
own
folly
alone
he
meant
to
resign
his
commission
immediately
as
to
his
future
situation
he
could
conjecture
very
little
about
he
must
go
somewhere
but
he
did
not
know
where
he
knew
he
nothing
to
live
on
mr
darcy
asked
him
why
he
had
not
married
your
sister
at
once
though
mr
bennet
was
not
imagined
to
be
very
rich
he
would
been
able
to
do
something
for
him
his
situation
must
been
benefited
by
marriage
but
he
found
in
reply
to
question
that
wickham
still
cherished
hope
more
effectually
making
his
fortune
by
marriage
in
some
other
country
under
such
circumstances
however
he
was
not
likely
to
be
proof
against
temptation
immediate
relief
they
met
several
times
for
there
was
much
to
be
discussed
wickham
course
wanted
more
than
he
could
get
but
at
length
was
reduced
to
be
reasonable
every
thing
being
settled
between
them
mr
darcy
s
next
step
was
to
make
your
uncle
acquainted
with
he
first
called
in
gracechurch
street
evening
before
came
home
but
mr
gardiner
could
not
be
seen
mr
darcy
found
on
further
inquiry
that
your
father
was
still
with
him
but
would
quit
town
next
morning
he
did
not
judge
your
father
to
be
person
whom
he
could
so
properly
consult
as
your
uncle
therefore
readily
postponed
seeing
him
till
after
departure
former
he
did
not
leave
his
name
till
next
day
was
only
known
that
gentleman
had
called
on
business
on
saturday
he
came
again
your
father
was
gone
your
uncle
at
home
as
said
before
they
had
great
deal
talk
together
they
met
again
on
sunday
then
saw
him
too
was
not
settled
before
monday
as
soon
as
was
express
was
sent
off
to
longbourn
but
our
visitor
was
very
obstinate
fancy
lizzy
that
obstinacy
real
defect
his
character
after
he
has
been
accused
many
faults
at
different
times
but
true
one
nothing
was
to
be
done
that
he
did
not
do
himself
though
sure
do
not
speak
to
be
thanked
therefore
say
nothing
about
your
uncle
would
most
readily
settled
whole
they
battled
together
for
long
time
which
was
more
than
either
gentleman
or
lady
concerned
in
deserved
but
at
last
your
uncle
was
forced
to
yield
instead
being
allowed
to
be
use
to
his
niece
was
forced
to
put
up
with
only
having
probable
credit
which
went
sorely
against
grain
really
believe
your
letter
morning
gave
him
great
pleasure
because
required
an
explanation
that
would
rob
him
his
borrowed
feathers
give
praise
where
was
due
but
lizzy
must
go
no
farther
than
yourself
or
jane
at
most
you
know
pretty
well
suppose
what
has
been
done
for
young
people
his
debts
to
be
paid
amounting
believe
to
considerably
more
than
thousand
pounds
another
thousand
in
addition
to
her
own
settled
upon
her
his
commission
purchased
reason
why
was
to
be
done
by
him
alone
was
such
as
given
above
was
owing
to
him
to
his
reserve
want
proper
consideration
that
wickham
s
character
had
been
so
misunderstood
consequently
that
he
had
been
received
noticed
as
he
was
perhaps
there
was
some
truth
in
though
doubt
whether
his
reserve
or
anybody
s
reserve
can
be
answerable
for
event
but
in
spite
fine
talking
my
dear
lizzy
you
may
rest
perfectly
assured
that
your
uncle
would
never
yielded
if
we
had
not
given
him
credit
for
another
interest
in
affair
when
was
resolved
on
he
returned
again
to
his
friends
who
were
still
staying
at
pemberley
but
was
agreed
that
he
be
in
london
once
more
when
wedding
took
place
money
matters
were
then
to
receive
last
finish
believe
now
told
you
every
thing
relation
which
you
tell
me
to
give
you
great
surprise
hope
at
least
will
not
afford
you
any
displeasure
lydia
came
to
us
wickham
had
constant
admission
to
house
he
was
exactly
what
he
had
been
when
knew
him
in
hertfordshire
but
would
not
tell
you
how
little
was
satisfied
with
her
behaviour
while
she
staid
with
us
if
had
not
perceived
by
jane
s
letter
last
wednesday
that
her
conduct
on
coming
home
was
exactly
piece
with
therefore
what
now
tell
you
can
give
you
no
fresh
pain
talked
to
her
repeatedly
in
most
serious
manner
representing
to
her
wickedness
what
she
had
done
unhappiness
she
had
brought
on
her
family
if
she
heard
me
was
by
good
luck
for
sure
she
did
not
listen
was
sometimes
quite
provoked
but
then
recollected
my
dear
elizabeth
jane
for
their
sakes
had
patience
with
her
mr
darcy
was
punctual
in
his
return
as
lydia
informed
you
attended
wedding
he
dined
with
us
next
day
was
to
leave
town
again
on
wednesday
or
thursday
will
you
be
very
angry
with
me
my
dear
lizzy
if
take
opportunity
saying
what
was
never
bold
enough
to
say
before
how
much
like
him
his
behaviour
to
us
has
in
every
respect
been
as
pleasing
as
when
we
were
in
derbyshire
his
understanding
opinions
please
me
he
wants
nothing
but
little
more
liveliness
that
if
he
marry
prudently
his
wife
may
teach
him
thought
him
very
sly
he
hardly
ever
mentioned
your
name
but
slyness
seems
fashion
pray
forgive
me
if
been
very
presuming
or
at
least
do
not
punish
me
so
far
as
to
exclude
me
from
p
shall
never
be
quite
happy
till
been
round
park
low
phaeton
with
nice
little
pair
ponies
would
be
very
thing
but
must
write
no
more
children
been
wanting
me
half
hour
yours
very
sincerely
m
gardiner
contents
letter
threw
elizabeth
into
flutter
spirits
in
which
was
difficult
to
determine
whether
pleasure
or
pain
bore
greatest
share
vague
unsettled
suspicions
which
uncertainty
had
produced
what
mr
darcy
might
been
doing
to
forward
her
sister
s
match
which
she
had
feared
to
encourage
as
an
exertion
goodness
too
great
to
be
probable
at
same
time
dreaded
to
be
just
from
pain
obligation
were
proved
beyond
their
greatest
extent
to
be
true
he
had
followed
them
purposely
to
town
he
had
taken
on
himself
trouble
mortification
attendant
on
such
research
in
which
supplication
had
been
necessary
to
woman
whom
he
must
abominate
despise
where
he
was
reduced
to
meet
frequently
meet
reason
with
persuade
finally
bribe
man
whom
he
always
most
wished
to
avoid
whose
very
name
was
punishment
to
him
to
pronounce
he
had
done
for
girl
whom
he
could
neither
regard
nor
esteem
her
heart
did
whisper
that
he
had
done
for
her
but
was
hope
shortly
checked
by
other
considerations
she
soon
felt
that
even
her
vanity
was
insufficient
when
required
to
depend
on
his
affection
for
her
for
woman
who
had
already
refused
him
as
able
to
overcome
sentiment
so
natural
as
abhorrence
against
relationship
with
wickham
brother
in
law
wickham
every
kind
pride
must
revolt
from
connection
he
had
to
be
sure
done
much
she
was
ashamed
to
think
how
much
but
he
had
given
reason
for
his
interference
which
asked
no
extraordinary
stretch
belief
was
reasonable
that
he
feel
he
had
been
wrong
he
had
liberality
he
had
means
exercising
though
she
would
not
place
herself
as
his
principal
inducement
she
could
perhaps
believe
that
remaining
partiality
for
her
might
assist
his
endeavours
in
cause
where
her
peace
mind
must
be
materially
concerned
was
painful
exceedingly
painful
to
know
that
they
were
under
obligations
to
person
who
could
never
receive
return
they
owed
restoration
lydia
her
character
every
thing
to
him
oh
how
heartily
did
she
grieve
over
every
ungracious
sensation
she
had
ever
encouraged
every
saucy
speech
she
had
ever
directed
towards
him
for
herself
she
was
humbled
but
she
was
proud
him
proud
that
in
cause
compassion
honour
he
had
been
able
to
get
better
himself
she
read
over
her
aunt
s
commendation
him
again
again
was
hardly
enough
but
pleased
her
she
was
even
sensible
some
pleasure
though
mixed
with
regret
on
finding
how
steadfastly
both
she
her
uncle
had
been
persuaded
that
affection
confidence
subsisted
between
mr
darcy
herself
she
was
roused
from
her
seat
her
reflections
by
some
one
s
approach
before
she
could
strike
into
another
path
she
was
overtaken
by
wickham
afraid
interrupt
your
solitary
ramble
my
dear
sister
said
he
as
he
joined
her
you
certainly
do
she
replied
with
smile
but
does
not
follow
that
interruption
must
be
unwelcome
be
sorry
indeed
if
were
we
were
always
good
friends
now
we
better
true
others
coming
out
do
not
know
mrs
bennet
lydia
going
in
carriage
to
meryton
so
my
dear
sister
find
from
our
uncle
aunt
that
you
actually
seen
pemberley
she
replied
in
affirmative
almost
envy
you
pleasure
yet
believe
would
be
too
much
for
me
or
else
could
take
in
my
way
to
newcastle
you
saw
old
housekeeper
suppose
poor
reynolds
she
was
always
very
fond
me
but
course
she
did
not
mention
my
name
to
you
yes
she
did
what
did
she
say
that
you
were
gone
into
army
she
was
afraid
had
not
turned
out
well
at
such
distance
as
that
you
know
things
strangely
misrepresented
certainly
he
replied
biting
his
lips
elizabeth
hoped
she
had
silenced
him
but
he
soon
afterwards
said
was
surprised
to
see
darcy
in
town
last
month
we
passed
each
other
several
times
wonder
what
he
can
be
doing
there
perhaps
preparing
for
his
marriage
with
miss
de
bourgh
said
elizabeth
must
be
something
particular
to
take
him
there
at
time
year
undoubtedly
did
you
see
him
while
you
were
at
lambton
thought
understood
from
gardiners
that
you
had
yes
he
introduced
us
to
his
sister
do
you
like
her
very
much
heard
indeed
that
she
uncommonly
improved
within
year
or
two
when
last
saw
her
she
was
not
very
promising
very
glad
you
liked
her
hope
she
will
turn
out
well
dare
say
she
will
she
has
got
over
most
trying
age
did
you
go
by
village
kympton
do
not
recollect
that
we
did
mention
because
living
which
ought
to
had
most
delightful
place
excellent
parsonage
house
would
suited
me
in
every
respect
how
you
liked
making
sermons
exceedingly
well
considered
as
part
my
duty
exertion
would
soon
been
nothing
one
ought
not
to
repine
but
to
be
sure
would
been
such
thing
for
me
quiet
retirement
such
life
would
answered
my
ideas
happiness
but
was
not
to
be
did
you
ever
hear
darcy
mention
circumstance
when
you
were
in
kent
heard
from
authority
which
thought
as
good
that
was
left
you
conditionally
only
at
will
present
patron
you
yes
there
was
something
in
that
told
you
so
from
first
you
may
remember
did
hear
too
that
there
was
time
when
sermon
making
was
not
so
palatable
to
you
as
seems
to
be
at
present
that
you
actually
declared
your
resolution
never
taking
orders
that
business
had
been
compromised
accordingly
you
did
was
not
wholly
without
foundation
you
may
remember
what
told
you
on
that
point
when
first
we
talked
they
were
now
almost
at
door
house
for
she
had
walked
fast
to
get
rid
him
unwilling
for
her
sister
s
sake
to
provoke
him
she
only
said
in
reply
with
good
humoured
smile
come
mr
wickham
we
brother
sister
you
know
do
not
let
us
quarrel
about
past
in
future
hope
we
shall
be
always
one
mind
she
held
out
her
hand
he
kissed
with
affectionate
gallantry
though
he
hardly
knew
how
to
look
they
entered
house
chapter
mr
wickham
was
so
perfectly
satisfied
with
conversation
that
he
never
again
distressed
himself
or
provoked
his
dear
sister
elizabeth
by
introducing
subject
she
was
pleased
to
find
that
she
had
said
enough
to
keep
him
quiet
day
his
lydia
s
departure
soon
came
mrs
bennet
was
forced
to
submit
to
separation
which
as
her
husband
by
no
means
entered
into
her
scheme
their
going
to
newcastle
was
likely
to
continue
at
least
twelvemonth
oh
my
dear
lydia
she
cried
when
shall
we
meet
again
oh
lord
don
t
know
not
these
two
or
years
perhaps
write
to
me
very
often
my
dear
as
often
as
can
but
you
know
married
women
never
much
time
for
writing
my
sisters
may
write
to
me
they
will
nothing
else
to
do
mr
wickham
s
adieus
were
much
more
affectionate
than
his
wife
s
he
smiled
looked
handsome
said
many
pretty
things
he
as
fine
fellow
said
mr
bennet
as
soon
as
they
were
out
house
as
ever
saw
he
simpers
smirks
makes
love
to
us
prodigiously
proud
him
defy
even
sir
william
lucas
himself
to
produce
more
valuable
son
in
law
loss
her
daughter
made
mrs
bennet
very
dull
for
several
days
often
think
said
she
that
there
nothing
so
bad
as
parting
with
one
s
friends
one
seems
so
forlorn
without
them
consequence
you
see
madam
marrying
daughter
said
elizabeth
must
make
you
better
satisfied
that
your
other
four
single
no
such
thing
lydia
does
not
leave
me
because
she
married
but
only
because
her
husband
s
regiment
happens
to
be
so
far
off
if
that
had
been
nearer
she
would
not
gone
so
soon
but
spiritless
condition
which
event
threw
her
into
was
shortly
relieved
her
mind
opened
again
to
agitation
hope
by
an
article
news
which
then
began
to
be
in
circulation
housekeeper
at
netherfield
had
received
orders
to
prepare
for
arrival
her
master
who
was
coming
down
in
day
or
two
to
shoot
there
for
several
weeks
mrs
bennet
was
quite
in
fidgets
she
looked
at
jane
smiled
shook
her
head
by
turns
well
well
so
mr
bingley
coming
down
sister
for
mrs
phillips
first
brought
her
news
well
so
much
better
not
that
care
about
though
he
nothing
to
us
you
know
sure
never
want
to
see
him
again
but
however
he
very
welcome
to
come
to
netherfield
if
he
likes
who
knows
what
may
happen
but
that
nothing
to
us
you
know
sister
we
agreed
long
ago
never
to
mention
word
about
so
quite
certain
he
coming
you
may
depend
on
replied
other
for
mrs
nicholls
was
in
meryton
last
night
saw
her
passing
by
went
out
myself
on
purpose
to
know
truth
she
told
me
that
was
certain
true
he
comes
down
on
thursday
at
latest
very
likely
on
wednesday
she
was
going
to
butcher
s
she
told
me
on
purpose
to
order
in
some
meat
on
wednesday
she
has
got
couple
ducks
just
fit
to
be
killed
miss
bennet
had
not
been
able
to
hear
his
coming
without
changing
colour
was
many
months
since
she
had
mentioned
his
name
to
elizabeth
but
now
as
soon
as
they
were
alone
together
she
said
saw
you
look
at
me
to
day
lizzy
when
my
aunt
told
us
present
report
know
appeared
distressed
but
don
t
imagine
was
from
any
silly
cause
was
only
confused
for
moment
because
felt
that
be
looked
at
do
assure
you
that
news
does
not
affect
me
either
with
pleasure
or
pain
glad
one
thing
that
he
comes
alone
because
we
shall
see
less
him
not
that
afraid
myself
but
dread
other
people
s
remarks
elizabeth
did
not
know
what
to
make
had
she
not
seen
him
in
derbyshire
she
might
supposed
him
capable
coming
there
with
no
other
view
than
what
was
acknowledged
but
she
still
thought
him
partial
to
jane
she
wavered
as
to
greater
probability
his
coming
there
with
his
friend
s
permission
or
being
bold
enough
to
come
without
yet
hard
she
sometimes
thought
that
poor
man
cannot
come
to
house
which
he
has
legally
hired
without
raising
speculation
will
leave
him
to
himself
in
spite
what
her
sister
declared
really
believed
to
be
her
feelings
in
expectation
his
arrival
elizabeth
could
easily
perceive
that
her
spirits
were
affected
by
they
were
more
disturbed
more
unequal
than
she
had
often
seen
them
subject
which
had
been
so
warmly
canvassed
between
their
parents
about
twelvemonth
ago
was
now
brought
forward
again
as
soon
as
ever
mr
bingley
comes
my
dear
said
mrs
bennet
you
will
wait
on
him
course
no
no
you
forced
me
into
visiting
him
last
year
promised
if
went
to
see
him
he
marry
one
my
daughters
but
ended
in
nothing
will
not
be
sent
on
fool
s
errand
again
his
wife
represented
to
him
how
absolutely
necessary
such
an
attention
would
be
from
neighbouring
gentlemen
on
his
returning
to
netherfield
tis
an
etiquette
despise
said
he
if
he
wants
our
society
let
him
seek
he
knows
where
we
live
will
not
spend
my
hours
in
running
after
my
neighbours
every
time
they
go
away
come
back
again
well
know
that
will
be
abominably
rude
if
you
do
not
wait
on
him
but
however
that
shan
t
prevent
my
asking
him
to
dine
here
determined
we
must
mrs
long
gouldings
soon
that
will
make
thirteen
with
ourselves
so
there
will
be
just
room
at
table
for
him
consoled
by
resolution
she
was
better
able
to
bear
her
husband
s
incivility
though
was
very
mortifying
to
know
that
her
neighbours
might
see
mr
bingley
in
consequence
before
they
did
as
day
his
arrival
drew
near
begin
to
be
sorry
that
he
comes
at
said
jane
to
her
sister
would
be
nothing
could
see
him
with
perfect
indifference
but
can
hardly
bear
to
hear
thus
perpetually
talked
my
mother
means
well
but
she
does
not
know
no
one
can
know
how
much
suffer
from
what
she
says
happy
shall
be
when
his
stay
at
netherfield
over
wish
could
say
anything
to
comfort
you
replied
elizabeth
but
wholly
out
my
power
you
must
feel
usual
satisfaction
preaching
patience
to
sufferer
denied
me
because
you
always
so
much
mr
bingley
arrived
mrs
bennet
through
assistance
servants
contrived
to
earliest
tidings
that
period
anxiety
fretfulness
on
her
side
might
be
as
long
as
could
she
counted
days
that
must
intervene
before
their
invitation
could
be
sent
hopeless
seeing
him
before
but
on
morning
after
his
arrival
in
hertfordshire
she
saw
him
from
her
dressing
room
window
enter
paddock
ride
towards
house
her
daughters
were
eagerly
called
to
partake
her
joy
jane
resolutely
kept
her
place
at
table
but
elizabeth
to
satisfy
her
mother
went
to
window
she
looked
she
saw
mr
darcy
with
him
sat
down
again
by
her
sister
there
gentleman
with
him
mamma
said
kitty
who
can
be
some
acquaintance
or
other
my
dear
suppose
sure
do
not
know
la
replied
kitty
looks
just
like
that
man
that
used
to
be
with
him
before
mr
what
s
his
name
that
tall
proud
man
good
gracious
mr
darcy
so
does
vow
well
any
friend
mr
bingley
s
will
always
be
welcome
here
to
be
sure
but
else
must
say
that
hate
very
sight
him
jane
looked
at
elizabeth
with
surprise
concern
she
knew
but
little
their
meeting
in
derbyshire
therefore
felt
for
awkwardness
which
must
attend
her
sister
in
seeing
him
almost
for
first
time
after
receiving
his
explanatory
letter
both
sisters
were
uncomfortable
enough
each
felt
for
other
course
for
themselves
their
mother
talked
on
her
dislike
mr
darcy
her
resolution
to
be
civil
to
him
only
as
mr
bingley
s
friend
without
being
heard
by
either
them
but
elizabeth
had
sources
uneasiness
which
could
not
be
suspected
by
jane
to
whom
she
had
never
yet
had
courage
to
shew
mrs
gardiner
s
letter
or
to
relate
her
own
change
sentiment
towards
him
to
jane
he
could
be
only
man
whose
proposals
she
had
refused
whose
merit
she
had
undervalued
but
to
her
own
more
extensive
information
he
was
person
to
whom
whole
family
were
indebted
for
first
benefits
whom
she
regarded
herself
with
an
interest
if
not
quite
so
tender
at
least
as
reasonable
just
as
what
jane
felt
for
bingley
her
astonishment
at
his
coming
at
his
coming
to
netherfield
to
longbourn
voluntarily
seeking
her
again
was
almost
equal
to
what
she
had
known
on
first
witnessing
his
altered
behaviour
in
derbyshire
colour
which
had
been
driven
from
her
face
returned
for
half
minute
with
an
additional
glow
smile
delight
added
lustre
to
her
eyes
as
she
thought
for
that
space
time
that
his
affection
wishes
must
still
be
unshaken
but
she
would
not
be
secure
let
me
first
see
how
he
behaves
said
she
will
then
be
early
enough
for
expectation
she
sat
intently
at
work
striving
to
be
composed
without
daring
to
lift
up
her
eyes
till
anxious
curiosity
carried
them
to
face
her
sister
as
servant
was
approaching
door
jane
looked
little
paler
than
usual
but
more
sedate
than
elizabeth
had
expected
on
gentlemen
s
appearing
her
colour
increased
yet
she
received
them
with
tolerable
ease
with
propriety
behaviour
equally
from
any
symptom
resentment
or
any
unnecessary
complaisance
elizabeth
said
as
little
to
either
as
civility
would
allow
sat
down
again
to
her
work
with
an
eagerness
which
did
not
often
command
she
had
ventured
only
one
glance
at
darcy
he
looked
serious
as
usual
she
thought
more
as
he
had
been
used
to
look
in
hertfordshire
than
as
she
had
seen
him
at
pemberley
but
perhaps
he
could
not
in
her
mother
s
presence
be
what
he
was
before
her
uncle
aunt
was
painful
but
not
an
improbable
conjecture
bingley
she
had
likewise
seen
for
an
instant
in
that
short
period
saw
him
looking
both
pleased
embarrassed
he
was
received
by
mrs
bennet
with
degree
civility
which
made
her
two
daughters
ashamed
especially
when
contrasted
with
cold
ceremonious
politeness
her
curtsey
address
to
his
friend
elizabeth
particularly
who
knew
that
her
mother
owed
to
latter
preservation
her
favourite
daughter
from
irremediable
infamy
was
hurt
distressed
to
most
painful
degree
by
distinction
so
ill
applied
darcy
after
inquiring
her
how
mr
mrs
gardiner
did
question
which
she
could
not
answer
without
confusion
said
scarcely
anything
he
was
not
seated
by
her
perhaps
that
was
reason
his
silence
but
had
not
been
so
in
derbyshire
there
he
had
talked
to
her
friends
when
he
could
not
to
herself
but
now
several
minutes
elapsed
without
bringing
sound
his
voice
when
occasionally
unable
to
resist
impulse
curiosity
she
raised
he
eyes
to
his
face
she
as
often
found
him
looking
at
jane
as
at
herself
frequently
on
no
object
but
ground
more
thoughtfulness
less
anxiety
to
please
than
when
they
last
met
were
plainly
expressed
she
was
disappointed
angry
with
herself
for
being
so
could
expect
to
be
otherwise
said
she
yet
why
did
he
come
she
was
in
no
humour
for
conversation
with
anyone
but
himself
to
him
she
had
hardly
courage
to
speak
she
inquired
after
his
sister
but
could
do
no
more
long
time
mr
bingley
since
you
went
away
said
mrs
bennet
he
readily
agreed
to
began
to
be
afraid
you
would
never
come
back
again
people
did
say
you
meant
to
quit
place
entirely
at
michaelmas
but
however
hope
not
true
great
many
changes
happened
in
neighbourhood
since
you
went
away
miss
lucas
married
settled
one
my
own
daughters
suppose
you
heard
indeed
you
must
seen
in
papers
was
in
times
courier
know
though
was
not
put
in
as
ought
to
be
was
only
said
lately
george
wickham
esq
to
miss
lydia
bennet
without
there
being
syllable
said
her
father
or
place
where
she
lived
or
anything
was
my
brother
gardiner
s
drawing
up
too
wonder
how
he
came
to
make
such
an
awkward
business
did
you
see
bingley
replied
that
he
did
made
his
congratulations
elizabeth
dared
not
lift
up
her
eyes
how
mr
darcy
looked
therefore
she
could
not
tell
delightful
thing
to
be
sure
to
daughter
well
married
continued
her
mother
but
at
same
time
mr
bingley
very
hard
to
her
taken
such
way
from
me
they
gone
down
to
newcastle
place
quite
northward
seems
there
they
to
stay
do
not
know
how
long
his
regiment
there
for
suppose
you
heard
his
leaving
shire
his
being
gone
into
regulars
thank
heaven
he
has
some
friends
though
perhaps
not
so
many
as
he
deserves
elizabeth
who
knew
to
be
levelled
at
mr
darcy
was
in
such
misery
shame
that
she
could
hardly
keep
her
seat
drew
from
her
however
exertion
speaking
which
nothing
else
had
so
effectually
done
before
she
asked
bingley
whether
he
meant
to
make
any
stay
in
country
at
present
few
weeks
he
believed
when
you
killed
your
own
birds
mr
bingley
said
her
mother
beg
you
will
come
here
shoot
as
many
as
you
please
on
mr
bennet
s
manor
sure
he
will
be
vastly
happy
to
oblige
you
will
save
best
covies
for
you
elizabeth
s
misery
increased
at
such
unnecessary
such
officious
attention
were
same
fair
prospect
to
arise
at
present
as
had
flattered
them
year
ago
every
thing
she
was
persuaded
would
be
hastening
to
same
vexatious
conclusion
at
that
instant
she
felt
that
years
happiness
could
not
make
jane
or
herself
amends
for
moments
such
painful
confusion
first
wish
my
heart
said
she
to
herself
never
more
to
be
in
company
with
either
them
their
society
can
afford
no
pleasure
that
will
atone
for
such
wretchedness
as
let
me
never
see
either
one
or
other
again
yet
misery
for
which
years
happiness
were
to
offer
no
compensation
received
soon
afterwards
material
relief
from
observing
how
much
beauty
her
sister
re
kindled
admiration
her
former
lover
when
first
he
came
in
he
had
spoken
to
her
but
little
but
every
five
minutes
seemed
to
be
giving
her
more
his
attention
he
found
her
as
handsome
as
she
had
been
last
year
as
good
natured
as
unaffected
though
not
quite
so
chatty
jane
was
anxious
that
no
difference
be
perceived
in
her
at
was
really
persuaded
that
she
talked
as
much
as
ever
but
her
mind
was
so
busily
engaged
that
she
did
not
always
know
when
she
was
silent
when
gentlemen
rose
to
go
away
mrs
bennet
was
mindful
her
intended
civility
they
were
invited
engaged
to
dine
at
longbourn
in
few
days
time
you
quite
visit
in
my
debt
mr
bingley
she
added
for
when
you
went
to
town
last
winter
you
promised
to
take
family
dinner
with
us
as
soon
as
you
returned
not
forgot
you
see
assure
you
was
very
much
disappointed
that
you
did
not
come
back
keep
your
engagement
bingley
looked
little
silly
at
reflection
said
something
his
concern
at
having
been
prevented
by
business
they
then
went
away
mrs
bennet
had
been
strongly
inclined
to
ask
them
to
stay
dine
there
that
day
but
though
she
always
kept
very
good
table
she
did
not
think
anything
less
than
two
courses
could
be
good
enough
for
man
on
whom
she
had
such
anxious
designs
or
satisfy
appetite
pride
one
who
had
ten
thousand
year
chapter
as
soon
as
they
were
gone
elizabeth
walked
out
to
recover
her
spirits
or
in
other
words
to
dwell
without
interruption
on
those
subjects
that
must
deaden
them
more
mr
darcy
s
behaviour
astonished
vexed
her
why
if
he
came
only
to
be
silent
grave
indifferent
said
she
did
he
come
at
she
could
settle
in
no
way
that
gave
her
pleasure
he
could
be
still
amiable
still
pleasing
to
my
uncle
aunt
when
he
was
in
town
why
not
to
me
if
he
fears
me
why
come
hither
if
he
no
longer
cares
for
me
why
silent
teasing
teasing
man
will
think
no
more
about
him
her
resolution
was
for
short
time
involuntarily
kept
by
approach
her
sister
who
joined
her
with
cheerful
look
which
showed
her
better
satisfied
with
their
visitors
than
elizabeth
now
said
she
that
first
meeting
over
feel
perfectly
easy
know
my
own
strength
shall
never
be
embarrassed
again
by
his
coming
glad
he
dines
here
on
tuesday
will
then
be
publicly
seen
that
on
both
sides
we
meet
only
as
common
indifferent
acquaintance
yes
very
indifferent
indeed
said
elizabeth
laughingly
oh
jane
take
care
my
dear
lizzy
you
cannot
think
me
so
weak
as
to
be
in
danger
now
think
you
in
very
great
danger
making
him
as
much
in
love
with
you
as
ever
they
did
not
see
gentlemen
again
till
tuesday
mrs
bennet
in
meanwhile
was
giving
way
to
happy
schemes
which
good
humour
common
politeness
bingley
in
half
an
hour
s
visit
had
revived
on
tuesday
there
was
large
party
assembled
at
longbourn
two
who
were
most
anxiously
expected
to
credit
their
punctuality
as
sportsmen
were
in
very
good
time
when
they
repaired
to
dining
room
elizabeth
eagerly
watched
to
see
whether
bingley
would
take
place
which
in
their
former
parties
had
belonged
to
him
by
her
sister
her
prudent
mother
occupied
by
same
ideas
forbore
to
invite
him
to
sit
by
herself
on
entering
room
he
seemed
to
hesitate
but
jane
happened
to
look
round
happened
to
smile
was
decided
he
placed
himself
by
her
elizabeth
with
triumphant
sensation
looked
towards
his
friend
he
bore
with
noble
indifference
she
would
imagined
that
bingley
had
received
his
sanction
to
be
happy
had
she
not
seen
his
eyes
likewise
turned
towards
mr
darcy
with
an
expression
half
laughing
alarm
his
behaviour
to
her
sister
was
such
during
dinner
time
as
showed
an
admiration
her
which
though
more
guarded
than
formerly
persuaded
elizabeth
that
if
left
wholly
to
himself
jane
s
happiness
his
own
would
be
speedily
secured
though
she
dared
not
depend
upon
consequence
she
yet
received
pleasure
from
observing
his
behaviour
gave
her
animation
that
her
spirits
could
boast
for
she
was
in
no
cheerful
humour
mr
darcy
was
almost
as
far
from
her
as
table
could
divide
them
he
was
on
one
side
her
mother
she
knew
how
little
such
situation
would
give
pleasure
to
either
or
make
either
appear
to
advantage
she
was
not
near
enough
to
hear
any
their
discourse
but
she
could
see
how
seldom
they
spoke
to
each
other
how
formal
cold
was
their
manner
whenever
they
did
her
mother
s
ungraciousness
made
sense
what
they
owed
him
more
painful
to
elizabeth
s
mind
she
would
at
times
given
anything
to
be
privileged
to
tell
him
that
his
kindness
was
neither
unknown
nor
unfelt
by
whole
family
she
was
in
hopes
that
evening
would
afford
some
opportunity
bringing
them
together
that
whole
visit
would
not
pass
away
without
enabling
them
to
enter
into
something
more
conversation
than
mere
ceremonious
salutation
attending
his
entrance
anxious
uneasy
period
which
passed
in
drawing
room
before
gentlemen
came
was
wearisome
dull
to
degree
that
almost
made
her
uncivil
she
looked
forward
to
their
entrance
as
point
on
which
her
chance
pleasure
for
evening
must
depend
if
he
does
not
come
to
me
then
said
she
shall
give
him
up
for
ever
gentlemen
came
she
thought
he
looked
as
if
he
would
answered
her
hopes
but
alas
ladies
had
crowded
round
table
where
miss
bennet
was
making
tea
elizabeth
pouring
out
coffee
in
so
close
confederacy
that
there
was
not
single
vacancy
near
her
which
would
admit
chair
on
gentlemen
s
approaching
one
girls
moved
closer
to
her
than
ever
said
in
whisper
men
shan
t
come
part
us
determined
we
want
none
them
do
we
darcy
had
walked
away
to
another
part
room
she
followed
him
with
her
eyes
envied
everyone
to
whom
he
spoke
had
scarcely
patience
enough
to
help
anybody
to
coffee
then
was
enraged
against
herself
for
being
so
silly
man
who
has
once
been
refused
how
could
ever
be
foolish
enough
to
expect
renewal
his
love
there
one
among
sex
who
would
not
protest
against
such
weakness
as
proposal
to
same
woman
there
no
indignity
so
abhorrent
to
their
feelings
she
was
little
revived
however
by
his
bringing
back
his
coffee
cup
himself
she
seized
opportunity
saying
your
sister
at
pemberley
still
yes
she
will
remain
there
till
christmas
quite
alone
her
friends
left
her
mrs
annesley
with
her
others
been
gone
on
to
scarborough
these
weeks
she
could
think
nothing
more
to
say
but
if
he
wished
to
converse
with
her
he
might
better
success
he
stood
by
her
however
for
some
minutes
in
silence
at
last
on
young
lady
s
whispering
to
elizabeth
again
he
walked
away
when
tea
things
were
removed
card
tables
placed
ladies
rose
elizabeth
was
then
hoping
to
be
soon
joined
by
him
when
her
views
were
overthrown
by
seeing
him
fall
victim
to
her
mother
s
rapacity
for
whist
players
in
few
moments
after
seated
with
rest
party
she
now
lost
every
expectation
pleasure
they
were
confined
for
evening
at
different
tables
she
had
nothing
to
hope
but
that
his
eyes
were
so
often
turned
towards
her
side
room
as
to
make
him
play
as
unsuccessfully
as
herself
mrs
bennet
had
designed
to
keep
two
netherfield
gentlemen
to
supper
but
their
carriage
was
unluckily
ordered
before
any
others
she
had
no
opportunity
detaining
them
well
girls
said
she
as
soon
as
they
were
left
to
themselves
what
say
you
to
day
think
every
thing
has
passed
off
uncommonly
well
assure
you
dinner
was
as
well
dressed
as
any
ever
saw
venison
was
roasted
to
turn
everybody
said
they
never
saw
so
fat
haunch
soup
was
fifty
times
better
than
what
we
had
at
lucases
last
week
even
mr
darcy
acknowledged
that
partridges
were
remarkably
well
done
suppose
he
has
two
or
french
cooks
at
least
my
dear
jane
never
saw
you
look
in
greater
beauty
mrs
long
said
so
too
for
asked
her
whether
you
did
not
what
do
you
think
she
said
besides
ah
mrs
bennet
we
shall
her
at
netherfield
at
last
she
did
indeed
do
think
mrs
long
as
good
creature
as
ever
lived
her
nieces
very
pretty
behaved
girls
not
at
handsome
like
them
prodigiously
mrs
bennet
in
short
was
in
very
great
spirits
she
had
seen
enough
bingley
s
behaviour
to
jane
to
be
convinced
that
she
would
get
him
at
last
her
expectations
advantage
to
her
family
when
in
happy
humour
were
so
far
beyond
reason
that
she
was
quite
disappointed
at
not
seeing
him
there
again
next
day
to
make
his
proposals
has
been
very
agreeable
day
said
miss
bennet
to
elizabeth
party
seemed
so
well
selected
so
suitable
one
with
other
hope
we
may
often
meet
again
elizabeth
smiled
lizzy
you
must
not
do
so
you
must
not
suspect
me
mortifies
me
assure
you
that
now
learnt
to
enjoy
his
conversation
as
an
agreeable
sensible
young
man
without
having
wish
beyond
perfectly
satisfied
from
what
his
manners
now
that
he
never
had
any
design
engaging
my
affection
only
that
he
blessed
with
greater
sweetness
address
stronger
desire
generally
pleasing
than
any
other
man
you
very
cruel
said
her
sister
you
will
not
let
me
smile
provoking
me
to
every
moment
how
hard
in
some
cases
to
be
believed
how
impossible
in
others
but
why
you
wish
to
persuade
me
that
feel
more
than
acknowledge
that
question
which
hardly
know
how
to
answer
we
love
to
instruct
though
we
can
teach
only
what
not
worth
knowing
forgive
me
if
you
persist
in
indifference
do
not
make
me
your
confidante
chapter
few
days
after
visit
mr
bingley
called
again
alone
his
friend
had
left
him
that
morning
for
london
but
was
to
return
home
in
ten
days
time
he
sat
with
them
above
an
hour
was
in
remarkably
good
spirits
mrs
bennet
invited
him
to
dine
with
them
but
with
many
expressions
concern
he
confessed
himself
engaged
elsewhere
next
time
you
call
said
she
hope
we
shall
be
more
lucky
he
be
particularly
happy
at
any
time
etc
etc
if
she
would
give
him
leave
would
take
an
early
opportunity
waiting
on
them
can
you
come
to
morrow
yes
he
had
no
engagement
at
for
to
morrow
her
invitation
was
accepted
with
alacrity
he
came
in
such
very
good
time
that
ladies
were
none
them
dressed
in
ran
mrs
bennet
to
her
daughter
s
room
in
her
dressing
gown
with
her
hair
half
finished
crying
out
my
dear
jane
make
haste
hurry
down
he
come

bingley

he
indeed
make
haste
make
haste

with
her
gown
never
mind
miss
lizzy
s
hair
we
will
be
down
as
soon
as
we
can
said
jane
but
dare
say
kitty
forwarder
than
either
us
for
she
went
up
stairs
half
an
hour
ago
oh
hang
kitty
what
has
she
to
do
with
come
be
quick
be
quick
where
your
sash
my
dear
but
when
her
mother
was
gone
jane
would
not
be
prevailed
on
to
go
down
without
one
her
sisters
same
anxiety
to
get
them
by
themselves
was
visible
again
in
evening
after
tea
mr
bennet
retired
to
library
as
was
his
custom
mary
went
up
stairs
to
her
instrument
two
obstacles
five
being
thus
removed
mrs
bennet
sat
looking
winking
at
elizabeth
catherine
for
considerable
time
without
making
any
impression
on
them
elizabeth
would
not
observe
her
when
at
last
kitty
did
she
very
innocently
said
what
matter
mamma
what
do
you
keep
winking
at
me
for
what
to
do
nothing
child
nothing
did
not
wink
at
you
she
then
sat
still
five
minutes
longer
but
unable
to
waste
such
precious
occasion
she
suddenly
got
up
saying
to
kitty
come
here
my
love
want
to
speak
to
you
took
her
out
room
jane
instantly
gave
look
at
elizabeth
which
spoke
her
distress
at
such
premeditation
her
entreaty
that
she
would
not
give
in
to
in
few
minutes
mrs
bennet
half
opened
door
called
out
lizzy
my
dear
want
to
speak
with
you
elizabeth
was
forced
to
go
we
may
as
well
leave
them
by
themselves
you
know
said
her
mother
as
soon
as
she
was
in
hall
kitty
going
upstairs
to
sit
in
my
dressing
room
elizabeth
made
no
attempt
to
reason
with
her
mother
but
remained
quietly
in
hall
till
she
kitty
were
out
sight
then
returned
into
drawing
room
mrs
bennet
s
schemes
for
day
were
ineffectual
bingley
was
every
thing
that
was
charming
except
professed
lover
her
daughter
his
ease
cheerfulness
rendered
him
most
agreeable
addition
to
their
evening
party
he
bore
with
ill
judged
officiousness
mother
heard
her
silly
remarks
with
forbearance
command
countenance
particularly
grateful
to
daughter
he
scarcely
needed
an
invitation
to
stay
supper
before
he
went
away
an
engagement
was
formed
chiefly
through
his
own
mrs
bennet
s
means
for
his
coming
next
morning
to
shoot
with
her
husband
after
day
jane
said
no
more
her
indifference
not
word
passed
between
sisters
concerning
bingley
but
elizabeth
went
to
bed
in
happy
belief
that
must
speedily
be
concluded
unless
mr
darcy
returned
within
stated
time
seriously
however
she
felt
tolerably
persuaded
that
must
taken
place
with
that
gentleman
s
concurrence
bingley
was
punctual
to
his
appointment
he
mr
bennet
spent
morning
together
as
had
been
agreed
on
latter
was
much
more
agreeable
than
his
companion
expected
there
was
nothing
presumption
or
folly
in
bingley
that
could
provoke
his
ridicule
or
disgust
him
into
silence
he
was
more
communicative
less
eccentric
than
other
had
ever
seen
him
bingley
course
returned
with
him
to
dinner
in
evening
mrs
bennet
s
invention
was
again
at
work
to
get
every
body
away
from
him
her
daughter
elizabeth
who
had
letter
to
write
went
into
breakfast
room
for
that
purpose
soon
after
tea
for
as
others
were
going
to
sit
down
to
cards
she
could
not
be
wanted
to
counteract
her
mother
s
schemes
but
on
returning
to
drawing
room
when
her
letter
was
finished
she
saw
to
her
infinite
surprise
there
was
reason
to
fear
that
her
mother
had
been
too
ingenious
for
her
on
opening
door
she
perceived
her
sister
bingley
standing
together
over
hearth
as
if
engaged
in
earnest
conversation
had
led
to
no
suspicion
faces
both
as
they
hastily
turned
round
moved
away
from
each
other
would
told
their
situation
was
awkward
enough
but
her
s
she
thought
was
still
worse
not
syllable
was
uttered
by
either
elizabeth
was
on
point
going
away
again
when
bingley
who
as
well
as
other
had
sat
down
suddenly
rose
whispering
few
words
to
her
sister
ran
out
room
jane
could
no
reserves
from
elizabeth
where
confidence
would
give
pleasure
instantly
embracing
her
acknowledged
with
liveliest
emotion
that
she
was
happiest
creature
in
world
tis
too
much
she
added
by
far
too
much
do
not
deserve
oh
why
not
everybody
as
happy
elizabeth
s
congratulations
were
given
with
sincerity
warmth
delight
which
words
could
but
poorly
express
every
sentence
kindness
was
fresh
source
happiness
to
jane
but
she
would
not
allow
herself
to
stay
with
her
sister
or
say
half
that
remained
to
be
said
for
present
must
go
instantly
to
my
mother
she
cried
would
not
on
any
account
trifle
with
her
affectionate
solicitude
or
allow
her
to
hear
from
anyone
but
myself
he
gone
to
my
father
already
oh
lizzy
to
know
that
what
to
relate
will
give
such
pleasure
to
my
dear
family
how
shall
bear
so
much
happiness
she
then
hastened
away
to
her
mother
who
had
purposely
broken
up
card
party
was
sitting
up
stairs
with
kitty
elizabeth
who
was
left
by
herself
now
smiled
at
rapidity
ease
with
which
an
affair
was
finally
settled
that
had
given
them
so
many
previous
months
suspense
vexation
said
she
end
his
friend
s
anxious
circumspection
his
sister
s
falsehood
contrivance
happiest
wisest
most
reasonable
end
in
few
minutes
she
was
joined
by
bingley
whose
conference
with
her
father
had
been
short
to
purpose
where
your
sister
said
he
hastily
as
he
opened
door
with
my
mother
up
stairs
she
will
be
down
in
moment
dare
say
he
then
shut
door
coming
up
to
her
claimed
good
wishes
affection
sister
elizabeth
honestly
heartily
expressed
her
delight
in
prospect
their
relationship
they
shook
hands
with
great
cordiality
then
till
her
sister
came
down
she
had
to
listen
to
he
had
to
say
his
own
happiness
jane
s
perfections
in
spite
his
being
lover
elizabeth
really
believed
his
expectations
felicity
to
be
rationally
founded
because
they
had
for
basis
excellent
understanding
super
excellent
disposition
jane
general
similarity
feeling
taste
between
her
himself
was
an
evening
no
common
delight
to
them
satisfaction
miss
bennet
s
mind
gave
glow
such
sweet
animation
to
her
face
as
made
her
look
handsomer
than
ever
kitty
simpered
smiled
hoped
her
turn
was
coming
soon
mrs
bennet
could
not
give
her
consent
or
speak
her
approbation
in
terms
warm
enough
to
satisfy
her
feelings
though
she
talked
to
bingley
nothing
else
for
half
an
hour
when
mr
bennet
joined
them
at
supper
his
voice
manner
plainly
showed
how
really
happy
he
was
not
word
however
passed
his
lips
in
allusion
to
till
their
visitor
took
his
leave
for
night
but
as
soon
as
he
was
gone
he
turned
to
his
daughter
said
jane
congratulate
you
you
will
be
very
happy
woman
jane
went
to
him
instantly
kissed
him
thanked
him
for
his
goodness
you
good
girl
he
replied
great
pleasure
in
thinking
you
will
be
so
happily
settled
not
doubt
your
doing
very
well
together
your
tempers
by
no
means
unlike
you
each
you
so
complying
that
nothing
will
ever
be
resolved
on
so
easy
that
every
servant
will
cheat
you
so
generous
that
you
will
always
exceed
your
income
hope
not
so
imprudence
or
thoughtlessness
in
money
matters
would
be
unpardonable
in
me
exceed
their
income
my
dear
mr
bennet
cried
his
wife
what
you
talking
why
he
has
four
or
five
thousand
year
very
likely
more
then
addressing
her
daughter
oh
my
dear
dear
jane
so
happy
sure
shan
t
get
wink
sleep
night
knew
how
would
be
always
said
must
be
so
at
last
was
sure
you
could
not
be
so
beautiful
for
nothing
remember
as
soon
as
ever
saw
him
when
he
first
came
into
hertfordshire
last
year
thought
how
likely
was
that
you
come
together
oh
he
handsomest
young
man
that
ever
was
seen
wickham
lydia
were
forgotten
jane
was
beyond
competition
her
favourite
child
at
that
moment
she
cared
for
no
other
her
younger
sisters
soon
began
to
make
interest
with
her
for
objects
happiness
which
she
might
in
future
be
able
to
dispense
mary
petitioned
for
use
library
at
netherfield
kitty
begged
very
hard
for
few
balls
there
every
winter
bingley
from
time
was
course
daily
visitor
at
longbourn
coming
frequently
before
breakfast
always
remaining
till
after
supper
unless
when
some
barbarous
neighbour
who
could
not
be
enough
detested
had
given
him
an
invitation
to
dinner
which
he
thought
himself
obliged
to
accept
elizabeth
had
now
but
little
time
for
conversation
with
her
sister
for
while
he
was
present
jane
had
no
attention
to
bestow
on
anyone
else
but
she
found
herself
considerably
useful
to
both
them
in
those
hours
separation
that
must
sometimes
occur
in
absence
jane
he
always
attached
himself
to
elizabeth
for
pleasure
talking
her
when
bingley
was
gone
jane
constantly
sought
same
means
relief
he
has
made
me
so
happy
said
she
one
evening
by
telling
me
that
he
was
totally
ignorant
my
being
in
town
last
spring
had
not
believed
possible
suspected
as
much
replied
elizabeth
but
how
did
he
account
for
must
been
his
sister
s
doing
they
were
certainly
no
friends
to
his
acquaintance
with
me
which
cannot
wonder
at
since
he
might
chosen
so
much
more
advantageously
in
many
respects
but
when
they
see
as
trust
they
will
that
their
brother
happy
with
me
they
will
learn
to
be
contented
we
shall
be
on
good
terms
again
though
we
can
never
be
what
we
once
were
to
each
other
that
most
unforgiving
speech
said
elizabeth
that
ever
heard
you
utter
good
girl
would
vex
me
indeed
to
see
you
again
dupe
miss
bingley
s
pretended
regard
would
you
believe
lizzy
that
when
he
went
to
town
last
november
he
really
loved
me
nothing
but
persuasion
my
being
indifferent
would
prevented
his
coming
down
again
he
made
little
mistake
to
be
sure
but
to
credit
his
modesty
naturally
introduced
panegyric
from
jane
on
his
diffidence
little
value
he
put
on
his
own
good
qualities
elizabeth
was
pleased
to
find
that
he
had
not
betrayed
interference
his
friend
for
though
jane
had
most
generous
forgiving
heart
in
world
she
knew
was
circumstance
which
must
prejudice
her
against
him
certainly
most
fortunate
creature
that
ever
existed
cried
jane
oh
lizzy
why
thus
singled
from
my
family
blessed
above
them
if
could
but
see
you
as
happy
if
there
were
but
such
another
man
for
you
if
you
were
to
give
me
forty
such
men
never
could
be
so
happy
as
you
till
your
disposition
your
goodness
never
can
your
happiness
no
no
let
me
shift
for
myself
perhaps
if
very
good
luck
may
meet
with
another
mr
collins
in
time
situation
affairs
in
longbourn
family
could
not
be
long
secret
mrs
bennet
was
privileged
to
whisper
to
mrs
phillips
she
ventured
without
any
permission
to
do
same
by
her
neighbours
in
meryton
bennets
were
speedily
pronounced
to
be
luckiest
family
in
world
though
only
few
weeks
before
when
lydia
had
first
run
away
they
had
been
generally
proved
to
be
marked
out
for
misfortune
chapter
one
morning
about
week
after
bingley
s
engagement
with
jane
had
been
formed
as
he
females
family
were
sitting
together
in
dining
room
their
attention
was
suddenly
drawn
to
window
by
sound
carriage
they
perceived
chaise
four
driving
up
lawn
was
too
early
in
morning
for
visitors
besides
equipage
did
not
answer
to
that
any
their
neighbours
horses
were
post
neither
carriage
nor
livery
servant
who
preceded
were
familiar
to
them
as
was
certain
however
that
somebody
was
coming
bingley
instantly
prevailed
on
miss
bennet
to
avoid
confinement
such
an
intrusion
walk
away
with
him
into
shrubbery
they
both
set
off
conjectures
remaining
continued
though
with
little
satisfaction
till
door
was
thrown
open
their
visitor
entered
was
lady
catherine
de
bourgh
they
were
course
intending
to
be
surprised
but
their
astonishment
was
beyond
their
expectation
on
part
mrs
bennet
kitty
though
she
was
perfectly
unknown
to
them
even
inferior
to
what
elizabeth
felt
she
entered
room
with
an
air
more
than
usually
ungracious
made
no
other
reply
to
elizabeth
s
salutation
than
slight
inclination
head
sat
down
without
saying
word
elizabeth
had
mentioned
her
name
to
her
mother
on
her
ladyship
s
entrance
though
no
request
introduction
had
been
made
mrs
bennet
amazement
though
flattered
by
having
guest
such
high
importance
received
her
with
utmost
politeness
after
sitting
for
moment
in
silence
she
said
very
stiffly
to
elizabeth
hope
you
well
miss
bennet
that
lady
suppose
your
mother
elizabeth
replied
very
concisely
that
she
was
that
suppose
one
your
sisters
yes
madam
said
mrs
bennet
delighted
to
speak
to
lady
catherine
she
my
youngest
girl
but
one
my
youngest
lately
married
my
eldest
somewhere
about
grounds
walking
with
young
man
who
believe
will
soon
become
part
family
you
very
small
park
here
returned
lady
catherine
after
short
silence
nothing
in
comparison
rosings
my
lady
dare
say
but
assure
you
much
larger
than
sir
william
lucas
s
must
be
most
inconvenient
sitting
room
for
evening
in
summer
windows
full
west
mrs
bennet
assured
her
that
they
never
sat
there
after
dinner
then
added
may
take
liberty
asking
your
ladyship
whether
you
left
mr
mrs
collins
well
yes
very
well
saw
them
night
before
last
elizabeth
now
expected
that
she
would
produce
letter
for
her
from
charlotte
as
seemed
only
probable
motive
for
her
calling
but
no
letter
appeared
she
was
completely
puzzled
mrs
bennet
with
great
civility
begged
her
ladyship
to
take
some
refreshment
but
lady
catherine
very
resolutely
not
very
politely
declined
eating
anything
then
rising
up
said
to
elizabeth
miss
bennet
there
seemed
to
be
prettyish
kind
little
wilderness
on
one
side
your
lawn
be
glad
to
take
turn
in
if
you
will
favour
me
with
your
company
go
my
dear
cried
her
mother
show
her
ladyship
about
different
walks
think
she
will
be
pleased
with
hermitage
elizabeth
obeyed
running
into
her
own
room
for
her
parasol
attended
her
noble
guest
downstairs
as
they
passed
through
hall
lady
catherine
opened
doors
into
dining
parlour
drawing
room
pronouncing
them
after
short
survey
to
be
decent
looking
rooms
walked
on
her
carriage
remained
at
door
elizabeth
saw
that
her
waiting
woman
was
in
they
proceeded
in
silence
along
gravel
walk
that
led
to
copse
elizabeth
was
determined
to
make
no
effort
for
conversation
with
woman
who
was
now
more
than
usually
insolent
disagreeable
how
could
ever
think
her
like
her
nephew
said
she
as
she
looked
in
her
face
as
soon
as
they
entered
copse
lady
catherine
began
in
following
manner
you
can
be
at
no
loss
miss
bennet
to
understand
reason
my
journey
hither
your
own
heart
your
own
conscience
must
tell
you
why
come
elizabeth
looked
with
unaffected
astonishment
indeed
you
mistaken
madam
not
been
at
able
to
account
for
honour
seeing
you
here
miss
bennet
replied
her
ladyship
in
an
angry
tone
you
ought
to
know
that
not
to
be
trifled
with
but
however
insincere
you
may
choose
to
be
you
shall
not
find
me
so
my
character
has
ever
been
celebrated
for
its
sincerity
frankness
in
cause
such
moment
as
shall
certainly
not
depart
from
report
most
alarming
nature
reached
me
two
days
ago
was
told
that
not
only
your
sister
was
on
point
being
most
advantageously
married
but
that
you
that
miss
elizabeth
bennet
would
in
likelihood
be
soon
afterwards
united
to
my
nephew
my
own
nephew
mr
darcy
though
know
must
be
scandalous
falsehood
though
would
not
injure
him
so
much
as
to
suppose
truth
possible
instantly
resolved
on
setting
off
for
place
that
might
make
my
sentiments
known
to
you
if
you
believed
impossible
to
be
true
said
elizabeth
colouring
with
astonishment
disdain
wonder
you
took
trouble
coming
so
far
what
could
your
ladyship
propose
by
at
once
to
insist
upon
having
such
report
universally
contradicted
your
coming
to
longbourn
to
see
me
my
family
said
elizabeth
coolly
will
be
rather
confirmation
if
indeed
such
report
in
existence
if
do
you
then
pretend
to
be
ignorant
has
not
been
industriously
circulated
by
yourselves
do
you
not
know
that
such
report
spread
abroad
never
heard
that
was
can
you
likewise
declare
that
there
no
foundation
for
do
not
pretend
to
possess
equal
frankness
with
your
ladyship
you
may
ask
questions
which
shall
not
choose
to
answer
not
to
be
borne
miss
bennet
insist
on
being
satisfied
has
he
has
my
nephew
made
you
an
offer
marriage
your
ladyship
has
declared
to
be
impossible
ought
to
be
so
must
be
so
while
he
retains
use
his
reason
but
your
arts
allurements
may
in
moment
infatuation
made
him
forget
what
he
owes
to
himself
to
his
family
you
may
drawn
him
in
if
shall
be
last
person
to
confess
miss
bennet
do
you
know
who
not
been
accustomed
to
such
language
as
almost
nearest
relation
he
has
in
world
entitled
to
know
his
dearest
concerns
but
you
not
entitled
to
know
mine
nor
will
such
behaviour
as
ever
induce
me
to
be
explicit
let
me
be
rightly
understood
match
to
which
you
presumption
to
aspire
can
never
take
place
no
never
mr
darcy
engaged
to
my
daughter
now
what
you
to
say
only
that
if
he
so
you
can
no
reason
to
suppose
he
will
make
an
offer
to
me
lady
catherine
hesitated
for
moment
then
replied
engagement
between
them
peculiar
kind
from
their
infancy
they
been
intended
for
each
other
was
favourite
wish
his
mother
as
well
as
her
s
while
in
their
cradles
we
planned
union
now
at
moment
when
wishes
both
sisters
would
be
accomplished
in
their
marriage
to
be
prevented
by
young
woman
inferior
birth
no
importance
in
world
wholly
unallied
to
family
do
you
pay
no
regard
to
wishes
his
friends
to
his
tacit
engagement
with
miss
de
bourgh
you
lost
to
every
feeling
propriety
delicacy
you
not
heard
me
say
that
from
his
earliest
hours
he
was
destined
for
his
cousin
yes
had
heard
before
but
what
that
to
me
if
there
no
other
objection
to
my
marrying
your
nephew
shall
certainly
not
be
kept
from
by
knowing
that
his
mother
aunt
wished
him
to
marry
miss
de
bourgh
you
both
did
as
much
as
you
could
in
planning
marriage
its
completion
depended
on
others
if
mr
darcy
neither
by
honour
nor
inclination
confined
to
his
cousin
why
not
he
to
make
another
choice
if
that
choice
why
may
not
accept
him
because
honour
decorum
prudence
nay
interest
forbid
yes
miss
bennet
interest
for
do
not
expect
to
be
noticed
by
his
family
or
friends
if
you
wilfully
act
against
inclinations
you
will
be
censured
slighted
despised
by
everyone
connected
with
him
your
alliance
will
be
disgrace
your
name
will
never
even
be
mentioned
by
any
us
these
heavy
misfortunes
replied
elizabeth
but
wife
mr
darcy
must
such
extraordinary
sources
happiness
necessarily
attached
to
her
situation
that
she
could
upon
whole
no
cause
to
repine
obstinate
headstrong
girl
ashamed
you
your
gratitude
for
my
attentions
to
you
last
spring
nothing
due
to
me
on
that
score
let
us
sit
down
you
to
understand
miss
bennet
that
came
here
with
determined
resolution
carrying
my
purpose
nor
will
be
dissuaded
from
not
been
used
to
submit
to
any
person

whims
not
been
in
habit
brooking
disappointment
that
will
make
your

situation
at
present
more
pitiable
but
will
no

me

not

me
in

formed
for
each

they
descended
on
maternal
side
from

noble
line
on

from

honourable
ancient
though
untitled
families
their
fortune
on
both
sides
splendid
they
destined
for
each

by

every

what

divide

without

connections
or

but
must
not
shall
not
be
if
you
were
sensible
your

good
you
would
not
wish
to
quit
sphere
in
which
you
been
brought
up
in
marrying
your

not
consider
myself
as

that
sphere
he

so
far
we
equal
true
you
gentleman

daughter
but
who
was
your
mother
who
your
uncles

do
not
imagine
me
ignorant
their
condition
whatever
my
connections
may
be
said
elizabeth
if
your
nephew
does
not
object
to
them
they
can
be
nothing
to
you
tell
me
once
for
you
engaged
to
him
though
elizabeth
would
not
for
mere
purpose
obliging
lady
catherine
answered
question
she
could
not
but
say
after
moment
s
deliberation
not
lady
catherine
seemed
pleased
will
you
promise
me
never
to
enter
into
such
an
engagement
will
make
no
promise
kind
miss
bennet
shocked
astonished
expected
to
find
more
reasonable
young
woman
but
do
not
deceive
yourself
into
belief
that
will
ever
recede
shall
not
go
away
till
you
given
me
assurance
require
certainly
never
shall
give
not
to
be
intimidated
into
anything
so
wholly
unreasonable
your
ladyship
wants
mr
darcy
to
marry
your
daughter
but
would
my
giving
you
wished
for
promise
make
their
marriage
at
more
probable
supposing
him
to
be
attached
to
me
would
my
refusing
to
accept
his
hand
make
him
wish
to
bestow
on
his
cousin
allow
me
to
say
lady
catherine
that
arguments
with
which
you
supported
extraordinary
application
been
as
frivolous
as
application
was
ill
judged
you
widely
mistaken
my
character
if
you
think
can
be
worked
on
by
such
persuasions
as
these
how
far
your
nephew
might
approve
your
interference
in
his
affairs
cannot
tell
but
you
certainly
no
right
to
concern
yourself
in
mine
must
beg
therefore
to
be
importuned
no
farther
on
subject
not
so
hasty
if
you
please
by
no

you
hoped
to
find
you
reasonable
but
depend
upon
will
carry
my
point
in
manner
lady
catherine
talked
on
till
they
were
at
door
carriage
when
turning
hastily
round
she
added
take
no
leave
you
miss
bennet
send
no
compliments
to
your
mother
you
deserve
no
such
attention
most
seriously
displeased
elizabeth
made
no
answer
without
attempting
to
persuade
her
ladyship
to
return
into
house
walked
quietly
into
herself
she
heard
carriage
drive
away
as
she
proceeded
up
stairs
her
mother
impatiently
met
her
at
door
dressing
room
to
ask
why
lady
catherine
would
not
come
in
again
rest
herself
she
did
not
choose
said
her
daughter
she
would
go
she
very
fine
looking
woman
her
calling
here
was
prodigiously
civil
for
she
only
came
suppose
to
tell
us
collinses
were
well
she
on
her
road
somewhere
dare
say
so
passing
through
meryton
thought
she
might
as
well
call
on
you
suppose
she
had
nothing
particular
to
say
to
you
lizzy
elizabeth
was
forced
to
give
into
little
falsehood
here
for
to
acknowledge
substance
their
conversation
was
impossible
chapter
discomposure
spirits
which
extraordinary
visit
threw
elizabeth
into
could
not
be
easily
overcome
nor
could
she
for
many
hours
learn
to
think
less
than
incessantly
lady
catherine
appeared
had
actually
taken
trouble
journey
from
rosings
for
sole
purpose
breaking
off
her
supposed
engagement
with
mr
darcy
was
rational
scheme
to
be
sure
but
from
what
report
their
engagement
could
originate
elizabeth
was
at
loss
to
imagine
till
she
recollected
that
his
being
intimate
friend
bingley
her
being
sister
jane
was
enough
at
time
when
expectation
one
wedding
made
everybody
eager
for
another
to
supply
idea
she
had
not
herself
forgotten
to
feel
that
marriage
her
sister
must
bring
them
more
frequently
together
her
neighbours
at
lucas
lodge
therefore
for
through
their
communication
with
collinses
report
she
concluded
had
reached
lady
catherine
had
only
set
that
down
as
almost
certain
immediate
which
she
had
looked
forward
to
as
possible
at
some
future
time
in
revolving
lady
catherine
s
expressions
however
she
could
not
help
feeling
some
uneasiness
as
to
possible
consequence
her
persisting
in
interference
from
what
she
had
said
her
resolution
to
prevent
their
marriage
occurred
to
elizabeth
that
she
must
meditate
an
application
to
her
nephew
how
he
might
take
similar
representation
evils
attached
to
connection
with
her
she
dared
not
pronounce
she
knew
not
exact
degree
his
affection
for
his
aunt
or
his
dependence
on
her
judgment
but
was
natural
to
suppose
that
he
thought
much
higher
her
ladyship
than
she
could
do
was
certain
that
in
enumerating
miseries
marriage
with
one
whose
immediate
connections
were
so
unequal
to
his
own
his
aunt
would
address
him
on
his
weakest
side
with
his
notions
dignity
he
would
probably
feel
that
arguments
which
to
elizabeth
had
appeared
weak
ridiculous
contained
much
good
sense
solid
reasoning
if
he
had
been
wavering
before
as
to
what
he
do
which
had
often
seemed
likely
advice
entreaty
so
near
relation
might
settle
every
doubt
determine
him
at
once
to
be
as
happy
as
dignity
unblemished
could
make
him
in
that
case
he
would
return
no
more
lady
catherine
might
see
him
in
her
way
through
town
his
engagement
to
bingley
coming
again
to
netherfield
must
give
way
if
therefore
an
excuse
for
not
keeping
his
promise
come
to
his
friend
within
few
days
she
added
shall
know
how
to
understand
shall
then
give
over
every
expectation
every
wish
his
constancy
if
he
satisfied
with
only
regretting
me
when
he
might
obtained
my
affections
hand
shall
soon
cease
to
regret
him
at
surprise
rest
family
on
hearing
who
their
visitor
had
been
was
very
great
but
they
obligingly
satisfied
with
same
kind
supposition
which
had
appeased
mrs
bennet
s
curiosity
elizabeth
was
spared
from
much
teasing
on
subject
next
morning
as
she
was
going
downstairs
she
was
met
by
her
father
who
came
out
his
library
with
letter
in
his
hand
lizzy
said
he
was
going
to
look
for
you
come
into
my
room
she
followed
him
thither
her
curiosity
to
know
what
he
had
to
tell
her
was
heightened
by
supposition
its
being
in
some
manner
connected
with
letter
he
held
suddenly
struck
her
that
might
be
from
lady
catherine
she
anticipated
with
dismay
consequent
explanations
she
followed
her
father
to
fire
place
they
both
sat
down
he
then
said
received
letter
morning
that
has
astonished
me
exceedingly
as
principally
concerns
yourself
you
ought
to
know
its
contents
did
not
know
before
that
had
two
daughters
on
brink
matrimony
let
me
congratulate
you
on
very
important
conquest
colour
now
rushed
into
elizabeth
s
cheeks
in
instantaneous
conviction
its
being
letter
from
nephew
instead
aunt
she
was
undetermined
whether
most
to
be
pleased
that
he
explained
himself
at
or
offended
that
his
letter
was
not
rather
addressed
to
herself
when
her
father
continued
you
look
conscious
young
ladies
great
penetration
in
such
matters
as
these
but
think
may
defy
even
your
sagacity
to
discover
name
your
admirer
letter
from
mr
collins
from
mr
collins
what
can
he
to
say
something
very
much
to
purpose
course
he
begins
with
congratulations
on
approaching
nuptials
my
eldest
daughter
which
seems
he
has
been
told
by
some
good
natured
gossiping
lucases
shall
not
sport
with
your
impatience
by
reading
what
he
says
on
that
point
what
relates
to
yourself
as
follows
having
thus
offered
you
sincere
congratulations
mrs
collins
myself
on
happy
event
let
me
now
add
short
hint
on
subject
another
which
we
been
advertised
by
same
authority
your
daughter
elizabeth
presumed
will
not
long
bear
name
bennet
after
her
elder
sister
has
resigned
chosen
partner
her
fate
may
be
reasonably
looked
up
to
as
one
most
illustrious
personages
in
land
can
you
possibly
guess
lizzy
who
meant
by
young
gentleman
blessed
in
peculiar
way
with
every
thing
heart
mortal
can
most
desire
splendid
property
noble
kindred
extensive
patronage
yet
in
spite
these
temptations
let
me
warn
my
cousin
elizabeth
yourself
what
evils
you
may
incur
by
precipitate
closure
with
gentleman
s
proposals
which
course
you
will
be
inclined
to
take
immediate
advantage
you
any
idea
lizzy
who
gentleman
but
now
comes
out
my
motive
for
cautioning
you
as
follows
we
reason
to
imagine
that
his
aunt
lady
catherine
de
bourgh
does
not
look
on
match
with
friendly
eye
mr
darcy
you
see
man
now
lizzy
think
surprised
you
could
he
or
lucases
pitched
on
any
man
within
circle
our
acquaintance
whose
name
would
given
lie
more
effectually
to
what
they
related
mr
darcy
who
never
looks
at
any
woman
but
to
see
blemish
who
probably
never
looked
at
you
in
his
life
admirable
elizabeth
tried
to
join
in
her
father
s
pleasantry
but
could
only
force
one
most
reluctant
smile
never
had
his
wit
been
directed
in
manner
so
little
agreeable
to
her
you
not
diverted
oh
yes
pray
read
on
after
mentioning
likelihood
marriage
to
her
ladyship
last
night
she
immediately
with
her
usual
condescension
expressed
what
she
felt
on
occasion
when
became
apparent
that
on
score
some
family
objections
on
part
my
cousin
she
would
never
give
her
consent
to
what
she
termed
so
disgraceful
match
thought
my
duty
to
give
speediest
intelligence
to
my
cousin
that
she
her
noble
admirer
may
be
aware
what
they
about
not
run
hastily
into
marriage
which
has
not
been
properly
sanctioned
mr
collins
moreover
adds
truly
rejoiced
that
my
cousin
lydia
s
sad
business
has
been
so
well
hushed
up
only
concerned
that
their
living
together
before
marriage
took
place
be
so
generally
known
must
not
however
neglect
duties
my
station
or
refrain
from
declaring
my
amazement
at
hearing
that
you
received
young
couple
into
your
house
as
soon
as
they
were
married
was
an
encouragement
vice
had
been
rector
longbourn
very
strenuously
opposed
you
ought
certainly
to
forgive
them
as
christian
but
never
to
admit
them
in
your
sight
or
allow
their
names
to
be
mentioned
in
your
hearing
that
his
notion
christian
forgiveness
rest
his
letter
only
about
his
dear
charlotte
s
situation
his
expectation
young
olive
branch
but
lizzy
you
look
as
if
you
did
not
enjoy
you
not
going
to
be
missish
hope
pretend
to
be
affronted
at
an
idle
report
for
what
do
we
live
but
to
make
sport
for
our
neighbours
laugh
at
them
in
our
turn
oh
cried
elizabeth
excessively
diverted
but
so
strange
yes
that
what
makes
amusing
had
they
fixed
on
any
other
man
would
been
nothing
but
his
perfect
indifference
your
pointed
dislike
make
so
delightfully
absurd
much
as
abominate
writing
would
not
give
up
mr
collins
s
correspondence
for
any
consideration
nay
when
read
letter
his
cannot
help
giving
him
preference
even
over
wickham
much
as
value
impudence
hypocrisy
my
son
in
law
pray
lizzy
what
said
lady
catherine
about
report
did
she
call
to
refuse
her
consent
to
question
his
daughter
replied
only
with
laugh
as
had
been
asked
without
least
suspicion
she
was
not
distressed
by
his
repeating
elizabeth
had
never
been
more
at
loss
to
make
her
feelings
appear
what
they
were
not
was
necessary
to
laugh
when
she
would
rather
cried
her
father
had
most
cruelly
mortified
her
by
what
he
said
mr
darcy
s
indifference
she
could
do
nothing
but
wonder
at
such
want
penetration
or
fear
that
perhaps
instead
his
seeing
too
little
she
might
fancied
too
much
chapter
instead
receiving
any
such
letter
excuse
from
his
friend
as
elizabeth
half
expected
mr
bingley
to
do
he
was
able
to
bring
darcy
with
him
to
longbourn
before
many
days
had
passed
after
lady
catherine
s
visit
gentlemen
arrived
early
before
mrs
bennet
had
time
to
tell
him
their
having
seen
his
aunt
which
her
daughter
sat
in
momentary
dread
bingley
who
wanted
to
be
alone
with
jane
proposed
their
walking
out
was
agreed
to
mrs
bennet
was
not
in
habit
walking
mary
could
never
spare
time
but
remaining
five
set
off
together
bingley
jane
however
soon
allowed
others
to
outstrip
them
they
lagged
behind
while
elizabeth
kitty
darcy
were
to
entertain
each
other
very
little
was
said
by
either
kitty
was
too
much
afraid
him
to
talk
elizabeth
was
secretly
forming
desperate
resolution
perhaps
he
might
be
doing
same
they
walked
towards
lucases
because
kitty
wished
to
call
upon
maria
as
elizabeth
saw
no
occasion
for
making
general
concern
when
kitty
left
them
she
went
boldly
on
with
him
alone
now
was
moment
for
her
resolution
to
be
executed
while
her
courage
was
high
she
immediately
said
mr
darcy
very
selfish
creature
for
sake
giving
relief
to
my
own
feelings
care
not
how
much
may
be
wounding
your
s
can
no
longer
help
thanking
you
for
your
unexampled
kindness
to
my
poor
sister
ever
since
known
been
most
anxious
to
acknowledge
to
you
how
gratefully
feel
were
known
to
rest
my
family
not
merely
my
own
gratitude
to
express
sorry
exceedingly
sorry
replied
darcy
in
tone
surprise
emotion
that
you
ever
been
informed
what
may
in
mistaken
light
given
you
uneasiness
did
not
think
mrs
gardiner
was
so
little
to
be
trusted
you
must
not
blame
my
aunt
lydia
s
thoughtlessness
first
betrayed
to
me
that
you
had
been
concerned
in
matter
course
could
not
rest
till
knew
particulars
let
me
thank
you
again
again
in
name
my
family
for
that
generous
compassion
which
induced
you
to
take
so
much
trouble
bear
so
many
mortifications
for
sake
discovering
them
if
you
will
thank
me
he
replied
let
be
for
yourself
alone
that
wish
giving
happiness
to
you
might
add
force
to
other
inducements
which
led
me
on
shall
not
attempt
to
deny
but
your
family
owe
me
nothing
much
as
respect
them
believe
thought
only
you
elizabeth
was
too
much
embarrassed
to
say
word
after
short
pause
her
companion
added
you
too
generous
to
trifle
with
me
if
your
feelings
still
what
they
were
last
april
tell
me
so
at
once
my
affections
wishes
unchanged
but
one
word
from
you
will
silence
me
on
subject
for
ever
elizabeth
feeling
more
than
common
awkwardness
anxiety
his
situation
now
forced
herself
to
speak
immediately
though
not
very
fluently
gave
him
to
understand
that
her
sentiments
had
undergone
so
material
change
since
period
to
which
he
alluded
as
to
make
her
receive
with
gratitude
pleasure
his
present
assurances
happiness
which
reply
produced
was
such
as
he
had
probably
never
felt
before
he
expressed
himself
on
occasion
as
sensibly
as
warmly
as
man
violently
in
love
can
be
supposed
to
do
had
elizabeth
been
able
to
encounter
his
eye
she
might
seen
how
well
expression
heartfelt
delight
diffused
over
his
face
became
him
but
though
she
could
not
look
she
could
listen
he
told
her
feelings
which
in
proving
what
importance
she
was
to
him
made
his
affection
every
moment
more
valuable
they
walked
on
without
knowing
in
what
direction
there
was
too
much
to
be
thought
felt
said
for
attention
to
any
other
objects
she
soon
learnt
that
they
were
indebted
for
their
present
good
understanding
to
efforts
his
aunt
who
did
call
on
him
in
her
return
through
london
there
relate
her
journey
to
longbourn
its
motive
substance
her
conversation
with
elizabeth
dwelling
emphatically
on
every
expression
latter
which
in
her
ladyship
s
apprehension
peculiarly
denoted
her
perverseness
assurance
in
belief
that
such
relation
must
assist
her
endeavours
to
obtain
that
promise
from
her
nephew
which
she
had
refused
to
give
but
unluckily
for
her
ladyship
its
effect
had
been
exactly
contrariwise
taught
me
to
hope
said
he
as
had
scarcely
ever
allowed
myself
to
hope
before
knew
enough
your
disposition
to
be
certain
that
had
you
been
absolutely
irrevocably
decided
against
me
you
would
acknowledged
to
lady
catherine
frankly
openly
elizabeth
coloured
laughed
as
she
replied
yes
you
know
enough
my
frankness
to
believe
me
capable
that
after
abusing
you
so
abominably
to
your
face
could
no
scruple
in
abusing
you
to
your
relations
what
did
you
say
me
that
did
not
deserve
for
though
your
accusations
were
ill
founded
formed
on
mistaken
premises
my
behaviour
to
you
at
time
had
merited
severest
reproof
was
unpardonable
cannot
think
without
abhorrence
we
will
not
quarrel
for
greater
share
blame
annexed
to
that
evening
said
elizabeth
conduct
neither
if
strictly
examined
will
be
irreproachable
but
since
then
we
both
hope
improved
in
civility
cannot
be
so
easily
reconciled
to
myself
recollection
what
then
said
my
conduct
my
manners
my
expressions
during
whole
now
has
been
many
months
inexpressibly
painful
to
me
your
reproof
so
well
applied
shall
never
forget
had
you
behaved
in
more
gentlemanlike
manner
those
were
your
words
you
know
not
you
can
scarcely
conceive
how
they
tortured
me
though
was
some
time
confess
before
was
reasonable
enough
to
allow
their
justice
was
certainly
very
far
from
expecting
them
to
make
so
strong
an
impression
had
not
smallest
idea
their
being
ever
felt
in
such
way
can
easily
believe
you
thought
me
then
devoid
every
proper
feeling
sure
you
did
turn
your
countenance
shall
never
forget
as
you
said
that
could
not
addressed
you
in
any
possible
way
that
would
induce
you
to
accept
me
oh
do
not
repeat
what
then
said
these
recollections
will
not
do
at
assure
you
that
long
been
most
heartily
ashamed
darcy
mentioned
his
letter
did
said
he
did
soon
make
you
think
better
me
did
you
on
reading
give
any
credit
to
its
contents
she
explained
what
its
effect
on
her
had
been
how
gradually
her
former
prejudices
had
been
removed
knew
said
he
that
what
wrote
must
give
you
pain
but
was
necessary
hope
you
destroyed
letter
there
was
one
part
especially
opening
which
dread
your
having
power
reading
again
can
remember
some
expressions
which
might
justly
make
you
hate
me
letter
shall
certainly
be
burnt
if
you
believe
essential
to
preservation
my
regard
but
though
we
both
reason
to
think
my
opinions
not
entirely
unalterable
they
not
hope
quite
so
easily
changed
as
that
implies
when
wrote
that
letter
replied
darcy
believed
myself
perfectly
calm
cool
but
since
convinced
that
was
written
in
dreadful
bitterness
spirit
letter
perhaps
began
in
bitterness
but
did
not
end
so
adieu
charity
itself
but
think
no
more
letter
feelings
person
who
wrote
person
who
received
now
so
widely
different
from
what
they
were
then
that
every
unpleasant
circumstance
attending
ought
to
be
forgotten
you
must
learn
some
my
philosophy
think
only
past
as
its
remembrance
gives
you
pleasure
cannot
give
you
credit
for
any
philosophy
kind
your
retrospections
must
be
so
totally
void
reproach
that
contentment
arising
from
them
not
philosophy
but
what
much
better
innocence
but
with
me
not
so
painful
recollections
will
intrude
which
cannot
which
ought
not
to
be
repelled
been
selfish
being
my
life
in
practice
though
not
in
principle
as
child
was
taught
what
was
right
but
was
not
taught
to
correct
my
temper
was
given
good
principles
but
left
to
follow
them
in
pride
conceit
unfortunately
an
only
son
for
many
years
an
only
child
was
spoilt
by
my
parents
who
though
good
themselves
my
father
particularly
that
was
benevolent
amiable
allowed
encouraged
almost
taught
me
to
be
selfish
overbearing
to
care
for
none
beyond
my
own
family
circle
to
think
meanly
rest
world
to
wish
at
least
to
think
meanly
their
sense
worth
compared
with
my
own
such
was
from
eight
to
eight
twenty
such
might
still
been
but
for
you
dearest
loveliest
elizabeth
what
do
not
owe
you
you
taught
me
lesson
hard
indeed
at
first
but
most
advantageous
by
you
was
properly
humbled
came
to
you
without
doubt
my
reception
you
showed
me
how
insufficient
were
my
pretensions
to
please
woman
worthy
being
pleased
had
you
then
persuaded
yourself
that
indeed
had
what
will
you
think
my
vanity
believed
you
to
be
wishing
expecting
my
addresses
my
manners
must
been
in
fault
but
not
intentionally
assure
you
never
meant
to
deceive
you
but
my
spirits
might
often
lead
me
wrong
how
you
must
hated
me
after
that
evening
hate
you
was
angry
perhaps
at
first
but
my
anger
soon
began
to
take
proper
direction
almost
afraid
asking
what
you
thought
me
when
we
met
at
pemberley
you
blamed
me
for
coming
no
indeed
felt
nothing
but
surprise
your
surprise
could
not
be
greater
than
mine
in
being
noticed
by
you
my
conscience
told
me
that
deserved
no
extraordinary
politeness
confess
that
did
not
expect
to
receive
more
than
my
due
my
object
then
replied
darcy
was
to
show
you
by
every
civility
in
my
power
that
was
not
so
mean
as
to
resent
past
hoped
to
obtain
your
forgiveness
to
lessen
your
ill
opinion
by
letting
you
see
that
your
reproofs
had
been
attended
to
how
soon
any
other
wishes
introduced
themselves
can
hardly
tell
but
believe
in
about
half
an
hour
after
had
seen
you
he
then
told
her
georgiana
s
delight
in
her
acquaintance
her
disappointment
at
its
sudden
interruption
which
naturally
leading
to
cause
that
interruption
she
soon
learnt
that
his
resolution
following
her
from
derbyshire
in
quest
her
sister
had
been
formed
before
he
quitted
inn
that
his
gravity
thoughtfulness
there
had
arisen
from
no
other
struggles
than
what
such
purpose
must
comprehend
she
expressed
her
gratitude
again
but
was
too
painful
subject
to
each
to
be
dwelt
on
farther
after
walking
several
miles
in
leisurely
manner
too
busy
to
know
anything
about
they
found
at
last
on
examining
their
watches
that
was
time
to
be
at
home
what
could
become
mr
bingley
jane
was
wonder
which
introduced
discussion
their
affairs
darcy
was
delighted
with
their
engagement
his
friend
had
given
him
earliest
information
must
ask
whether
you
were
surprised
said
elizabeth
not
at
when
went
away
felt
that
would
soon
happen
that
to
say
you
had
given
your
permission
guessed
as
much
though
he
exclaimed
at
term
she
found
that
had
been
pretty
much
case
on
evening
before
my
going
to
london
said
he
made
confession
to
him
which
believe
ought
to
made
long
ago
told
him
that
had
occurred
to
make
my
former
interference
in
his
affairs
absurd
impertinent
his
surprise
was
great
he
had
never
had
slightest
suspicion
told
him
moreover
that
believed
myself
mistaken
in
supposing
as
had
done
that
your
sister
was
indifferent
to
him
as
could
easily
perceive
that
his
attachment
to
her
was
unabated
felt
no
doubt
their
happiness
together
elizabeth
could
not
help
smiling
at
his
easy
manner
directing
his
friend
did
you
speak
from
your
own
observation
said
she
when
you
told
him
that
my
sister
loved
him
or
merely
from
my
information
last
spring
from
former
had
narrowly
observed
her
during
two
visits
which
had
lately
made
here
was
convinced
her
affection
your
assurance
suppose
carried
immediate
conviction
to
him
did
bingley
most
unaffectedly
modest
his
diffidence
had
prevented
his
depending
on
his
own
judgment
in
so
anxious
case
but
his
reliance
on
mine
made
every
thing
easy
was
obliged
to
confess
one
thing
which
for
time
not
unjustly
offended
him
could
not
allow
myself
to
conceal
that
your
sister
had
been
in
town
months
last
winter
that
had
known
purposely
kept
from
him
he
was
angry
but
his
anger
persuaded
lasted
no
longer
than
he
remained
in
any
doubt
your
sister
s
sentiments
he
has
heartily
forgiven
me
now
elizabeth
longed
to
observe
that
mr
bingley
had
been
most
delightful
friend
so
easily
guided
that
his
worth
was
invaluable
but
she
checked
herself
she
remembered
that
he
had
yet
to
learn
to
be
laughed
at
was
rather
too
early
to
begin
in
anticipating
happiness
bingley
which
course
was
to
be
inferior
only
to
his
own
he
continued
conversation
till
they
reached
house
in
hall
they
parted
chapter
my
dear
lizzy
where
can
you
been
walking
to
was
question
which
elizabeth
received
from
jane
as
soon
as
she
entered
their
room
from
others
when
they
sat
down
to
table
she
had
only
to
say
in
reply
that
they
had
wandered
about
till
she
was
beyond
her
own
knowledge
she
coloured
as
she
spoke
but
neither
that
nor
anything
else
awakened
suspicion
truth
evening
passed
quietly
unmarked
by
anything
extraordinary
acknowledged
lovers
talked
laughed
unacknowledged
were
silent
darcy
was
not
disposition
in
which
happiness
overflows
in
mirth
elizabeth
agitated
confused
rather
knew
that
she
was
happy
than
felt
herself
to
be
so
for
besides
immediate
embarrassment
there
were
other
evils
before
her
she
anticipated
what
would
be
felt
in
family
when
her
situation
became
known
she
was
aware
that
no
one
liked
him
but
jane
even
feared
that
with
others
was
dislike
which
not
his
fortune
consequence
might
do
away
at
night
she
opened
her
heart
to
jane
though
suspicion
was
very
far
from
miss
bennet
s
general
habits
she
was
absolutely
incredulous
here
you
joking
lizzy
cannot
be
engaged
to
mr
darcy
no
no
you
shall
not
deceive
me
know
to
be
impossible
wretched
beginning
indeed
my
sole
dependence
was
on
you
sure
nobody
else
will
believe
me
if
you
do
not
yet
indeed
in
earnest
speak
nothing
but
truth
he
still
loves
me
we
engaged
jane
looked
at
her
doubtingly
oh
lizzy
cannot
be
know
how
much
you
dislike
him
you
know
nothing
matter
that
to
be
forgot
perhaps
did
not
always
love
him
so
well
as
do
now
but
in
such
cases
as
these
good
memory
unpardonable
last
time
shall
ever
remember
myself
miss
bennet
still
looked
amazement
elizabeth
again
more
seriously
assured
her
its
truth
good
heaven
can
be
really
so
yet
now
must
believe
you
cried
jane
my
dear
dear
lizzy
would
do
congratulate
you
but
you
certain
forgive
question
you
quite
certain
that
you
can
be
happy
with
him
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
settled
between
us
already
that
we
to
be
happiest
couple
in
world
but
you
pleased
jane
shall
you
like
to
such
brother
very
very
much
nothing
could
give
either
bingley
or
myself
more
delight
but
we
considered
we
talked
as
impossible
do
you
really
love
him
quite
well
enough
oh
lizzy
do
anything
rather
than
marry
without
affection
you
quite
sure
that
you
feel
what
you
ought
to
do
oh
yes
you
will
only
think
feel
more
than
ought
to
do
when
tell
you
what
do
you
mean
why
must
confess
that
love
him
better
than
do
bingley
afraid
you
will
be
angry
my
dearest
sister
now
be
serious
want
to
talk
very
seriously
let
me
know
every
thing
that
to
know
without
delay
will
you
tell
me
how
long
you
loved
him
has
been
coming
on
so
gradually
that
hardly
know
when
began
but
believe
must
date
from
my
first
seeing
his
beautiful
grounds
at
pemberley
another
entreaty
that
she
would
be
serious
however
produced
desired
effect
she
soon
satisfied
jane
by
her
solemn
assurances
attachment
when
convinced
on
that
article
miss
bennet
had
nothing
further
to
wish
now
quite
happy
said
she
for
you
will
be
as
happy
as
myself
always
had
value
for
him
were
for
nothing
but
his
love
you
must
always
esteemed
him
but
now
as
bingley
s
friend
your
husband
there
can
be
only
bingley
yourself
more
dear
to
me
but
lizzy
you
been
very
sly
very
reserved
with
me
how
little
did
you
tell
me
what
passed
at
pemberley
lambton
owe
that
know
to
another
not
to
you
elizabeth
told
her
motives
her
secrecy
she
had
been
unwilling
to
mention
bingley
unsettled
state
her
own
feelings
had
made
her
equally
avoid
name
his
friend
but
now
she
would
no
longer
conceal
from
her
his
share
in
lydia
s
marriage
was
acknowledged
half
night
spent
in
conversation
good
gracious
cried
mrs
bennet
as
she
stood
at
window
next
morning
if
that
disagreeable
mr
darcy
not
coming
here
again
with
our
dear
bingley
what
can
he
mean
by
being
so
tiresome
as
to
be
always
coming
here
had
no
notion
but
he
would
go
shooting
or
something
or
other
not
disturb
us
with
his
company
what
shall
we
do
with
him
lizzy
you
must
walk
out
with
him
again
that
he
may
not
be
in
bingley
s
way
elizabeth
could
hardly
help
laughing
at
so
convenient
proposal
yet
was
really
vexed
that
her
mother
be
always
giving
him
such
an
epithet
as
soon
as
they
entered
bingley
looked
at
her
so
expressively
shook
hands
with
such
warmth
as
left
no
doubt
his
good
information
he
soon
afterwards
said
aloud
mrs
bennet
you
no
more
lanes
hereabouts
in
which
lizzy
may
lose
her
way
again
to
day
advise
mr
darcy
lizzy
kitty
said
mrs
bennet
to
walk
to
oakham
mount
morning
nice
long
walk
mr
darcy
has
never
seen
view
may
do
very
well
for
others
replied
mr
bingley
but
sure
will
be
too
much
for
kitty
won
t
kitty
kitty
owned
that
she
had
rather
stay
at
home
darcy
professed
great
curiosity
to
see
view
from
mount
elizabeth
silently
consented
as
she
went
up
stairs
to
get
ready
mrs
bennet
followed
her
saying
quite
sorry
lizzy
that
you
be
forced
to
that
disagreeable
man
to
yourself
but
hope
you
will
not
mind
for
jane
s
sake
you
know
there
no
occasion
for
talking
to
him
except
just
now
then
so
do
not
put
yourself
to
inconvenience
during
their
walk
was
resolved
that
mr
bennet
s
consent
be
asked
in
course
evening
elizabeth
reserved
to
herself
application
for
her
mother
s
she
could
not
determine
how
her
mother
would
take
sometimes
doubting
whether
his
wealth
grandeur
would
be
enough
to
overcome
her
abhorrence
man
but
whether
she
were
violently
set
against
match
or
violently
delighted
with
was
certain
that
her
manner
would
be
equally
ill
adapted
to
do
credit
to
her
sense
she
could
no
more
bear
that
mr
darcy
hear
first
raptures
her
joy
than
first
vehemence
her
disapprobation
in
evening
soon
after
mr
bennet
withdrew
to
library
she
saw
mr
darcy
rise
also
follow
him
her
agitation
on
seeing
was
extreme
she
did
not
fear
her
father
s
opposition
but
he
was
going
to
be
made
unhappy
that
be
through
her
means
that
she
his
favourite
child
be
distressing
him
by
her
choice
be
filling
him
with
fears
regrets
in
disposing
her
was
wretched
reflection
she
sat
in
misery
till
mr
darcy
appeared
again
when
looking
at
him
she
was
little
relieved
by
his
smile
in
few
minutes
he
approached
table
where
she
was
sitting
with
kitty
while
pretending
to
admire
her
work
said
in
whisper
go
to
your
father
he
wants
you
in
library
she
was
gone
directly
her
father
was
walking
about
room
looking
grave
anxious
lizzy
said
he
what
you
doing
you
out
your
senses
to
be
accepting
man
not
you
always
hated
him
how
earnestly
did
she
then
wish
that
her
former
opinions
had
been
more
reasonable
her
expressions
more
moderate
would
spared
her
from
explanations
professions
which
was
exceedingly
awkward
to
give
but
they
were
now
necessary
she
assured
him
with
some
confusion
her
attachment
to
mr
darcy
or
in
other
words
you
determined
to
him
he
rich
to
be
sure
you
may
more
fine
clothes
fine
carriages
than
jane
but
will
they
make
you
happy
you
any
other
objection
said
elizabeth
than
your
belief
my
indifference
none
at
we
know
him
to
be
proud
unpleasant
sort
man
but
would
be
nothing
if
you
really
liked
him
do
do
like
him
she
replied
with
tears
in
her
eyes
love
him
indeed
he
has
no
improper
pride
he
perfectly
amiable
you
do
not
know
what
he
really
then
pray
do
not
pain
me
by
speaking
him
in
such
terms
lizzy
said
her
father
given
him
my
consent
he
kind
man
indeed
to
whom
never
dare
refuse
anything
which
he
condescended
to
ask
now
give
to
you
if
you
resolved
on
having
him
but
let
me
advise
you
to
think
better
know
your
disposition
lizzy
know
that
you
could
be
neither
happy
nor
respectable
unless
you
truly
esteemed
your
husband
unless
you
looked
up
to
him
as
superior
your
lively
talents
would
place
you
in
greatest
danger
in
an
unequal
marriage
you
could
scarcely
escape
discredit
misery
my
child
let
me
not
grief
seeing
you
unable
to
respect
your
partner
in
life
you
know
not
what
you
about
elizabeth
still
more
affected
was
earnest
solemn
in
her
reply
at
length
by
repeated
assurances
that
mr
darcy
was
really
object
her
choice
by
explaining
gradual
change
which
her
estimation
him
had
undergone
relating
her
absolute
certainty
that
his
affection
was
not
work
day
but
had
stood
test
many
months
suspense
enumerating
with
energy
his
good
qualities
she
did
conquer
her
father
s
incredulity
reconcile
him
to
match
well
my
dear
said
he
when
she
ceased
speaking
no
more
to
say
if
be
case
he
deserves
you
could
not
parted
with
you
my
lizzy
to
anyone
less
worthy
to
complete
favourable
impression
she
then
told
him
what
mr
darcy
had
voluntarily
done
for
lydia
he
heard
her
with
astonishment
an
evening
wonders
indeed
so
darcy
did
every
thing
made
up
match
gave
money
paid
fellow
s
debts
got
him
his
commission
so
much
better
will
save
me
world
trouble
economy
had
been
your
uncle
s
doing
must
would
paid
him
but
these
violent
young
lovers
carry
every
thing
their
own
way
shall
offer
to
pay
him
to
morrow
he
will
rant
storm
about
his
love
for
you
there
will
be
an
end
matter
he
then
recollected
her
embarrassment
few
days
before
on
his
reading
mr
collins
s
letter
after
laughing
at
her
some
time
allowed
her
at
last
to
go
saying
as
she
quitted
room
if
any
young
men
come
for
mary
or
kitty
send
them
in
for
quite
at
leisure
elizabeth
s
mind
was
now
relieved
from
very
heavy
weight
after
half
an
hour
s
quiet
reflection
in
her
own
room
she
was
able
to
join
others
with
tolerable
composure
every
thing
was
too
recent
for
gaiety
but
evening
passed
tranquilly
away
there
was
no
longer
anything
material
to
be
dreaded
comfort
ease
familiarity
would
come
in
time
when
her
mother
went
up
to
her
dressing
room
at
night
she
followed
her
made
important
communication
its
effect
was
most
extraordinary
for
on
first
hearing
mrs
bennet
sat
quite
still
unable
to
utter
syllable
nor
was
under
many
many
minutes
that
she
could
comprehend
what
she
heard
though
not
in
general
backward
to
credit
what
was
for
advantage
her
family
or
that
came
in
shape
lover
to
any
them
she
began
at
length
to
recover
to
fidget
about
in
her
chair
get
up
sit
down
again
wonder
bless
herself
good
gracious
lord
bless
me
only
think
dear
me
mr
darcy
who
would
thought
really
true
oh
my
sweetest
lizzy
how
rich
how
great
you
will
be
what
pin
money
what
jewels
what
carriages
you
will
jane
s
nothing
to
nothing
at
so
pleased
so
happy
such
charming
man
so
handsome
so
tall
oh
my
dear
lizzy
pray
apologise
for
my
having
disliked
him
so
much
before
hope
he
will
overlook
dear
dear
lizzy
house
in
town
every
thing
that
charming
daughters
married
ten
thousand
year
oh
lord
what
will
become
me
shall
go
distracted
was
enough
to
prove
that
her
approbation
need
not
be
doubted
elizabeth
rejoicing
that
such
an
effusion
was
heard
only
by
herself
soon
went
away
but
before
she
had
been
minutes
in
her
own
room
her
mother
followed
her
my
dearest
child
she
cried
can
think
nothing
else
ten
thousand
year
very
likely
more
tis
as
good
as
lord
special
licence
you
must
shall
be
married
by
special
licence
but
my
dearest
love
tell
me
what
dish
mr
darcy
particularly
fond
that
may
to
morrow
was
sad
omen
what
her
mother
s
behaviour
to
gentleman
himself
might
be
elizabeth
found
that
though
in
certain
possession
his
warmest
affection
secure
her
relations
consent
there
was
still
something
to
be
wished
for
but
morrow
passed
off
much
better
than
she
expected
for
mrs
bennet
luckily
stood
in
such
awe
her
intended
son
in
law
that
she
ventured
not
to
speak
to
him
unless
was
in
her
power
to
offer
him
any
attention
or
mark
her
deference
for
his
opinion
elizabeth
had
satisfaction
seeing
her
father
taking
pains
to
get
acquainted
with
him
mr
bennet
soon
assured
her
that
he
was
rising
every
hour
in
his
esteem
admire
my
sons
in
law
highly
said
he
wickham
perhaps
my
favourite
but
think
shall
like
your
husband
quite
as
well
as
jane
s
chapter
elizabeth
s
spirits
soon
rising
to
playfulness
again
she
wanted
mr
darcy
to
account
for
his
having
ever
fallen
in
love
with
her
how
could
you
begin
said
she
can
comprehend
your
going
on
charmingly
when
you
had
once
made
beginning
but
what
could
set
you
off
in
first
place
cannot
fix
on
hour
or
spot
or
look
or
words
which
laid
foundation
too
long
ago
was
in
middle
before
knew
that
had
begun
my
beauty
you
had
early
withstood
as
for
my
manners
my
behaviour
to
you
was
at
least
always
bordering
on
uncivil
never
spoke
to
you
without
rather
wishing
to
give
you
pain
than
not
now
be
sincere
did
you
admire
me
for
my
impertinence
for
liveliness
your
mind
did
you
may
as
well
call
impertinence
at
once
was
very
little
less
fact
that
you
were
sick
civility
deference
officious
attention
you
were
disgusted
with
women
who
were
always
speaking
looking
thinking
for
your
approbation
alone
roused
interested
you
because
was
so
unlike
them
had
you
not
been
really
amiable
you
would
hated
me
for
but
in
spite
pains
you
took
to
disguise
yourself
your
feelings
were
always
noble
just
in
your
heart
you
thoroughly
despised
persons
who
so
assiduously
courted
you
there
saved
you
trouble
accounting
for
really
things
considered
begin
to
think
perfectly
reasonable
to
be
sure
you
knew
no
actual
good
me
but
nobody
thinks
that
when
they
fall
in
love
was
there
no
good
in
your
affectionate
behaviour
to
jane
while
she
was
ill
at
netherfield
dearest
jane
who
could
done
less
for
her
but
make
virtue
by
means
my
good
qualities
under
your
protection
you
to
exaggerate
them
as
much
as
possible
in
return
belongs
to
me
to
find
occasions
for
teasing
quarrelling
with
you
as
often
as
may
be
shall
begin
directly
by
asking
you
what
made
you
so
unwilling
to
come
to
point
at
last
what
made
you
so
shy
me
when
you
first
called
afterwards
dined
here
why
especially
when
you
called
did
you
look
as
if
you
did
not
care
about
me
because
you
were
grave
silent
gave
me
no
encouragement
but
was
embarrassed
so
was
you
might
talked
to
me
more
when
you
came
to
dinner
man
who
had
felt
less
might
how
unlucky
that
you
reasonable
answer
to
give
that
be
so
reasonable
as
to
admit
but
wonder
how
long
you
would
gone
on
if
you
had
been
left
to
yourself
wonder
when
you
would
spoken
if
had
not
asked
you
my
resolution
thanking
you
for
your
kindness
to
lydia
had
certainly
great
effect
too
much
afraid
for
what
becomes
moral
if
our
comfort
springs
from
breach
promise
for
ought
not
to
mentioned
subject
will
never
do
you
need
not
distress
yourself
moral
will
be
perfectly
fair
lady
catherine
s
unjustifiable
endeavours
to
separate
us
were
means
removing
my
doubts
not
indebted
for
my
present
happiness
to
your
eager
desire
expressing
your
gratitude
was
not
in
humour
to
wait
for
any
opening
your
s
my
aunt
s
intelligence
had
given
me
hope
was
determined
at
once
to
know
every
thing
lady
catherine
has
been
infinite
use
which
ought
to
make
her
happy
for
she
loves
to
be
use
but
tell
me
what
did
you
come
down
to
netherfield
for
was
merely
to
ride
to
longbourn
be
embarrassed
or
had
you
intended
any
more
serious
consequence
my
real
purpose
was
to
see
you
to
judge
if
could
whether
might
ever
hope
to
make
you
love
me
my
avowed
one
or
what
avowed
to
myself
was
to
see
whether
your
sister
were
still
partial
to
bingley
if
she
were
to
make
confession
to
him
which
since
made
shall
you
ever
courage
to
announce
to
lady
catherine
what
to
befall
her
more
likely
to
want
more
time
than
courage
elizabeth
but
ought
to
be
done
if
you
will
give
me
sheet
paper
shall
be
done
directly
if
had
not
letter
to
write
myself
might
sit
by
you
admire
evenness
your
writing
as
another
young
lady
once
did
but
an
aunt
too
who
must
not
be
longer
neglected
from
an
unwillingness
to
confess
how
much
her
intimacy
with
mr
darcy
had
been
over
rated
elizabeth
had
never
yet
answered
mrs
gardiner
s
long
letter
but
now
having
that
to
communicate
which
she
knew
would
be
most
welcome
she
was
almost
ashamed
to
find
that
her
uncle
aunt
had
already
lost
days
happiness
immediately
wrote
as
follows
would
thanked
you
before
my
dear
aunt
as
ought
to
done
for
your
long
kind
satisfactory
detail
particulars
but
to
say
truth
was
too
cross
to
write
you
supposed
more
than
really
existed
but
now
suppose
as
much
as
you
choose
give
loose
rein
to
your
fancy
indulge
your
imagination
in
every
possible
flight
which
subject
will
afford
unless
you
believe
me
actually
married
you
cannot
greatly
err
you
must
write
again
very
soon
praise
him
great
deal
more
than
you
did
in
your
last
thank
you
again
again
for
not
going
to
lakes
how
could
be
so
silly
as
to
wish
your
idea
ponies
delightful
we
will
go
round
park
every
day
happiest
creature
in
world
perhaps
other
people
said
so
before
but
not
one
with
such
justice
happier
even
than
jane
she
only
smiles
laugh
mr
darcy
sends
you
love
in
world
that
he
can
spare
from
me
you
to
come
to
pemberley
at
christmas
yours
etc
mr
darcy
s
letter
to
lady
catherine
was
in
different
style
still
different
from
either
was
what
mr
bennet
sent
to
mr
collins
in
reply
to
his
last
dear
sir
must
trouble
you
once
more
for
congratulations
elizabeth
will
soon
be
wife
mr
darcy
console
lady
catherine
as
well
as
you
can
but
if
were
you
would
stand
by
nephew
he
has
more
to
give
yours
sincerely
etc
miss
bingley
s
congratulations
to
her
brother
on
his
approaching
marriage
were
that
was
affectionate
insincere
she
wrote
even
to
jane
on
occasion
to
express
her
delight
repeat
her
former
professions
regard
jane
was
not
deceived
but
she
was
affected
though
feeling
no
reliance
on
her
could
not
help
writing
her
much
kinder
answer
than
she
knew
was
deserved
joy
which
miss
darcy
expressed
on
receiving
similar
information
was
as
sincere
as
her
brother
s
in
sending
four
sides
paper
were
insufficient
to
contain
her
delight
her
earnest
desire
being
loved
by
her
sister
before
any
answer
could
arrive
from
mr
collins
or
any
congratulations
to
elizabeth
from
his
wife
longbourn
family
heard
that
collinses
were
come
themselves
to
lucas
lodge
reason
sudden
removal
was
soon
evident
lady
catherine
had
been
rendered
so
exceedingly
angry
by
contents
her
nephew
s
letter
that
charlotte
really
rejoicing
in
match
was
anxious
to
get
away
till
storm
was
blown
over
at
such
moment
arrival
her
friend
was
sincere
pleasure
to
elizabeth
though
in
course
their
meetings
she
must
sometimes
think
pleasure
dearly
bought
when
she
saw
mr
darcy
exposed
to
parading
obsequious
civility
her
husband
he
bore
however
with
admirable
calmness
he
could
even
listen
to
sir
william
lucas
when
he
complimented
him
on
carrying
away
brightest
jewel
country
expressed
his
hopes
their
meeting
frequently
at
st
james
s
with
very
decent
composure
if
he
did
shrug
his
shoulders
was
not
till
sir
william
was
out
sight
mrs
phillips
s
vulgarity
was
another
perhaps
greater
tax
on
his
forbearance
though
mrs
phillips
as
well
as
her
sister
stood
in
too
much
awe
him
to
speak
with
familiarity
which
bingley
s
good
humour
encouraged
yet
whenever
she
did
speak
she
must
be
vulgar
nor
was
her
respect
for
him
though
made
her
more
quiet
at
likely
to
make
her
more
elegant
elizabeth
did
she
could
to
shield
him
from
frequent
notice
either
was
ever
anxious
to
keep
him
to
herself
to
those
her
family
with
whom
he
might
converse
without
mortification
though
uncomfortable
feelings
arising
from
took
from
season
courtship
much
its
pleasure
added
to
hope
future
she
looked
forward
with
delight
to
time
when
they
be
removed
from
society
so
little
pleasing
to
either
to
comfort
elegance
their
family
party
at
pemberley
chapter
happy
for
her
maternal
feelings
was
day
on
which
mrs
bennet
got
rid
her
two
most
deserving
daughters
with
what
delighted
pride
she
afterwards
visited
mrs
bingley
talked
mrs
darcy
may
be
guessed
wish
could
say
for
sake
her
family
that
accomplishment
her
earnest
desire
in
establishment
so
many
her
children
produced
so
happy
an
effect
as
to
make
her
sensible
amiable
well
informed
woman
for
rest
her
life
though
perhaps
was
lucky
for
her
husband
who
might
not
relished
domestic
felicity
in
so
unusual
form
that
she
still
was
occasionally
nervous
invariably
silly
mr
bennet
missed
his
daughter
exceedingly
his
affection
for
her
drew
him
oftener
from
home
than
anything
else
could
do
he
delighted
in
going
to
pemberley
especially
when
he
was
least
expected
mr
bingley
jane
remained
at
netherfield
only
twelvemonth
so
near
vicinity
to
her
mother
meryton
relations
was
not
desirable
even
to
his
easy
temper
or
her
affectionate
heart
darling
wish
his
sisters
was
then
gratified
he
bought
an
estate
in
neighbouring
county
to
derbyshire
jane
elizabeth
in
addition
to
every
other
source
happiness
were
within
thirty
miles
each
other
kitty
to
her
very
material
advantage
spent
chief
her
time
with
her
two
elder
sisters
in
society
so
superior
to
what
she
had
generally
known
her
improvement
was
great
she
was
not
so
ungovernable
temper
as
lydia
removed
from
influence
lydia
s
example
she
became
by
proper
attention
management
less
irritable
less
ignorant
less
insipid
from
further
disadvantage
lydia
s
society
she
was
course
carefully
kept
though
mrs
wickham
frequently
invited
her
to
come
stay
with
her
with
promise
balls
young
men
her
father
would
never
consent
to
her
going
mary
was
only
daughter
who
remained
at
home
she
was
necessarily
drawn
from
pursuit
accomplishments
by
mrs
bennet
s
being
quite
unable
to
sit
alone
mary
was
obliged
to
mix
more
with
world
but
she
could
still
moralize
over
every
morning
visit
as
she
was
no
longer
mortified
by
comparisons
between
her
sisters
beauty
her
own
was
suspected
by
her
father
that
she
submitted
to
change
without
much
reluctance
as
for
wickham
lydia
their
characters
suffered
no
revolution
from
marriage
her
sisters
he
bore
with
philosophy
conviction
that
elizabeth
must
now
become
acquainted
with
whatever
his
ingratitude
falsehood
had
before
been
unknown
to
her
in
spite
every
thing
was
not
wholly
without
hope
that
darcy
might
yet
be
prevailed
on
to
make
his
fortune
congratulatory
letter
which
elizabeth
received
from
lydia
on
her
marriage
explained
to
her
that
by
his
wife
at
least
if
not
by
himself
such
hope
was
cherished
letter
was
to
effect
my
dear
lizzy
wish
you
joy
if
you
love
mr
darcy
half
as
well
as
do
my
dear
wickham
you
must
be
very
happy
great
comfort
to
you
so
rich
when
you
nothing
else
to
do
hope
you
will
think
us
sure
wickham
would
like
place
at
court
very
much
do
not
think
we
shall
quite
money
enough
to
live
upon
without
some
help
any
place
would
do
about
or
four
hundred
year
but
however
do
not
speak
to
mr
darcy
about
if
you
had
rather
not
yours
etc
as
happened
that
elizabeth
had
much
rather
not
she
endeavoured
in
her
answer
to
put
an
end
to
every
entreaty
expectation
kind
such
relief
however
as
was
in
her
power
to
afford
by
practice
what
might
be
called
economy
in
her
own
private
expences
she
frequently
sent
them
had
always
been
evident
to
her
that
such
an
income
as
theirs
under
direction
two
persons
so
extravagant
in
their
wants
heedless
future
must
be
very
insufficient
to
their
support
whenever
they
changed
their
quarters
either
jane
or
herself
were
sure
being
applied
to
for
some
little
assistance
towards
discharging
their
bills
their
manner
living
even
when
restoration
peace
dismissed
them
to
home
was
unsettled
in
extreme
they
were
always
moving
from
place
to
place
in
quest
cheap
situation
always
spending
more
than
they
ought
his
affection
for
her
soon
sunk
into
indifference
her
s
lasted
little
longer
in
spite
her
youth
her
manners
she
retained
claims
to
reputation
which
her
marriage
had
given
her
though
darcy
could
never
receive
him
at
pemberley
yet
for
elizabeth
s
sake
he
assisted
him
further
in
his
profession
lydia
was
occasionally
visitor
there
when
her
husband
was
gone
to
enjoy
himself
in
london
or
bath
with
bingleys
they
both
them
frequently
staid
so
long
that
even
bingley
s
good
humour
was
overcome
he
proceeded
so
far
as
to
talk
giving
them
hint
to
be
gone
miss
bingley
was
very
deeply
mortified
by
darcy
s
marriage
but
as
she
thought
advisable
to
retain
right
visiting
at
pemberley
she
dropt
her
resentment
was
fonder
than
ever
georgiana
almost
as
attentive
to
darcy
as
heretofore
paid
off
every
arrear
civility
to
elizabeth
pemberley
was
now
georgiana
s
home
attachment
sisters
was
exactly
what
darcy
had
hoped
to
see
they
were
able
to
love
each
other
even
as
well
as
they
intended
georgiana
had
highest
opinion
in
world
elizabeth
though
at
first
she
often
listened
with
an
astonishment
bordering
on
alarm
at
her
lively
sportive
manner
talking
to
her
brother
he
who
had
always
inspired
in
herself
respect
which
almost
overcame
her
affection
she
now
saw
object
open
pleasantry
her
mind
received
knowledge
which
had
never
before
fallen
in
her
way
by
elizabeth
s
instructions
she
began
to
comprehend
that
woman
may
take
liberties
with
her
husband
which
brother
will
not
always
allow
in
sister
more
than
ten
years
younger
than
himself
lady
catherine
was
extremely
indignant
on
marriage
her
nephew
as
she
gave
way
to
genuine
frankness
her
character
in
her
reply
to
letter
which
announced
its
arrangement
she
sent
him
language
so
very
abusive
especially
elizabeth
that
for
some
time
intercourse
was
at
an
end
but
at
length
by
elizabeth
s
persuasion
he
was
prevailed
on
to
overlook
offence
seek
reconciliation
after
little
further
resistance
on
part
his
aunt
her
resentment
gave
way
either
to
her
affection
for
him
or
her
curiosity
to
see
how
his
wife
conducted
herself
she
condescended
to
wait
on
them
at
pemberley
in
